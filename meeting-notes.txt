Discussion
Release 3.1.2? [Farina]
Will cut later today [probably by Farina] unless someone else get there first
Vision for HelmHub: how to choose the right chart for a product? [Marc]
The stable and incubator Helm chart repositories, currently listed on the Helm Hub, have begun a 1 year deprecation timeline. After 6 months they will be de-listed from the Hub (soon to be CNCF hub). See helm/charts > Status of the Project and Deprecation Timeline
The Helm Hub has a process for Adding distributed Helm repos, and the stable and incubator repos have a process for Deprecating a Chart once this is completed
Orgs and individuals can host distributed Helm repos however they wish, but if they want to use Helm-created tools (chart testing, releasing, etc) they can follow this example to use Helm Chart repo Actions: https://github.com/helm/charts-repo-actions-demo
There is a stub issue to help track migration, here https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/21103 (this will be fleshed out soon. While each deprecated chart README links to it's new home, this issue primarily to help the community see the migration at a glance)
We have engaged with a number of orgs who develop the apps to host charts for those apps (here is a working list that will be added to that github issue soon https://hackmd.io/VgK7_DUpS6CLLT4HSncmDg)
Helm.sh used to have a link to the sig-apps meeting recordings (not helm-specific) but now just points to https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/communication.md#meetings - do we have a specific link or playlist we want to publish for the Helm dev call? These get recorded - but where do people watch them? [Bridget] / Posting Helm dev call videos [Marc]
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVt9l4b66d5EY5Xs9OVJgvO5ss9WzrSY0
Fisher will migrate videos from Zoom to Youtube
Adam points out there‚Äôs a doc in keybase with the necessary info
Helm v2 utility library (https://github.com/maorfr/helm-plugin-utils/) request move to Helm org [Martin]
Discuss next week
Docs:
Improvement of library chart docs  https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/526  [Martin]
One review done by Matt Fisher. Can we get another core maintainer review?
Plugin shell-completion (which is in 3.2) https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/506 [Marc]
Fisher just approved and merged
Follow-up meeting on kube 1.16^ [Marc]
Adam will talk to Farina
Please include Martin and Marc
Should we split this file by decade? üòÅ Slow on a phone in the subway. [Marc]
Butcher: we could migrate past years to a markdown doc in github - Marc to open issue in community repo
Please take a critical look at https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7649 (resource adoption)! [Jacob]

Adam
Worked on upgrading Kubernetes and depreciated K8s resources


Discussion
Kubernetes broken versioning [Adam] https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7219
We rely on the libraries kubectl uses - and that no longer supports some old versions
Farina: this problem is going to keep happening/get worse (because the API server/kubectl won‚Äôt work with older versions)
Farina: should we add Helm lint rules around this?
Fisher: yes; we should give a warning/message in these cases
Adam: we could build a binary outside of helm for conversion

Contributing Guide? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7585 [discussion suggested by Bridget, based on issue opened by Matt Farina]
How do we handle things at project level? All the bits and pieces.
Then handle things at code level? Maybe better code doc/GoDoc.
How do you dive in? How you get started?
How do you lower the barrier?
Farina to maybe drive this outside of the weekly meeting?
Gpg signing [mattfarina] https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7599
Best practice for handling kube 1.16 removed APIs? Helm v2 or Helm v3? [Marc]
Big issue we need to be able to handle
Vanilla `kubectl` can handle this, Helm needs to be able to diff against deprecated api to new api in cluster
Adama to investigate
CRDs not available during `dry-run`: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7449 [martin]
Do we document that this is a limitation?
Should this issue be marked as a feature?

Discussion
Restore issue triage position? [mattfarina]
Assign specific person/persons to do triage for a specific week
Fisher: can we do assignments async on the maintainers list?
Bridget: we should document how to do the triaging
Farina: maintainers who aren‚Äôt core maintainers could also sign up
Martin: new core maintainers can learn how to triage by pairing
Farina: let‚Äôs start by reinstating the role and writing docs
Add a ‚ÄúNEWS‚Äù file to help with release notes? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7581 [Marc]
Merge conflicts mean a single file is a challenge
Adam suggests an update to the github template
Fisher will link to another tool that helps.
What versions of Helm should be in docs? https://github.com/helm/helm-www/issues/497 [mattfarina]
Fisher: Ronan added version dropdown list between individual versions - 2.14 does not have a specific need to be on there
Adam: we‚Äôre constantly changing docs (not synced with specific versions)
Farina: k8s does it with each minor release but each release is a breaking change - let‚Äôs remove the process and just have ‚Äúhelm 2‚Äù and ‚Äúhelm 3‚Äù but in helm 3 docs, specify minor version when the change came in
Adam - include a section for anything that‚Äôs changed in the docs
Fisher: bring it back to Ronan
Farina: will continue convo with Ronan

Scott Morgan: I‚Äôve had a PR sitting around for a while. Looking to find a core maintainer to move this around (7060)
Martin: how come the apiVersion had to be updated? `helm lint` should work with older chart APIs
Fisher: to resolve this, let‚Äôs add this to 3.2.0 so we can review it for the next release
Travis raines: https://github.com/helm/chart-testing/issues/202
Taylor: I‚Äôll have to dig into this one a little more. --wait can be a bit of a finicky thing and can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs the issue immediately
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6920 ‚Äúhelm upgrade --install‚Äù purposefully ignores installation errors. Why? [Marc]
Butcher: I‚Äôll review this offline
Should helm env show XDG paths? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6892 Result of offline discussion between Farina and Adam? [Marc]
Farina: we shouldn‚Äôt be showing XDG-related environment variables. We should expose it as a Helm-specific variable in its place
Action item: farina to push a PR
Should Helm transform API versions? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7575 [Farina]
Farina: the code has changed significantly since it was originally posted, so I can‚Äôt start a discussion on this. We‚Äôll have to revisit this PR before discussing.

Discussion
When should we cut the 3.1.0 RC? (Farina, Bridget)
RC 3.1 tomorrow (Feb 7) - Farina willing to cut the release
Release 3.1: tentatively, Feb 13
RC 3.2 March 11, release March 18
One last sync up on post render [Taylor]
Farina considered this to be for one-off scripts and trying to understand use case
Martin: this capability has some inherent risks - perhaps we should document more than restrict
Farina wants a good pattern for this; Taylor is going to comment/explain future enchancements.
What should we do with https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6794? [Taylor]
Namespace mechanism is more declarative than before - but might be okay? [Taylor]
Farina: you‚Äôre moving namespace choices from one role to another with this change
Fisher: The role conflicts aren‚Äôt fixed by this PR - the lookup functionality is the same.
Farina suggesting an opt-in flag for auto-creation
Adam: it was a much-desired feature to limit releases to a namespace
Should helm-plugin-utils (https://github.com/maorfr/helm-plugin-utils) be moved to Helm org? [Maor/Martin]
Fisher: is this a Helm2-only plugin? If so we‚Äôd want that to be clear
Farina: there is no license on this repo yet
Should helm env show XDG paths? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6892 [Marc]
Marc: XDG paths get default values when no set, which are hard to discern
Farina: debugging is difficult for XDG - this workaround would make our lives easier
Adam: XDG is unix/linux specific, so we probably want to call this ‚Äúconfig root directory‚Äù or some such
Farina: we have an issue about setting locations - the ability to use multiple path separators doesn‚Äôt currently work
Adam & Farina will follow up offline
Update on --name flag https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7345 [Marc]
Marc: Farina noted that many READMEs mention this
Fisher: core maintainers are making design decisions - we‚Äôll listen but not change based on one community member‚Äôs opinion

Let‚Äôs discuss a date for 3.1.0 (Farina)

Taylor: let‚Äôs make sure the k8s libraries are updated
Yes: Joe Langford did this
Fisher: let‚Äôs check a few regressions, but yes, this could work
Farina: by the call next week, we‚Äôll know when we can cut the RC
Fisher: will put some PRs for discussion in the helm dev channel
Prettify Updated time in helm ls [Martin]: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7024
Breaking change or not?
Helmsman (a 3rd party tool) is consuming the table and the time
Potential path forward:
Move to local timezone and remove the fraction of a second. It‚Äôs same format with difference in accuracy
See what this means for helmsman and parsing the information
Would be nice for ls and history to be consistent
Dependency digest differs between Helm 2 and 3: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7261 [Martin]
Need review and feedback if right approach
Fisher: consistent calculation?
Farina: there is a complication around dependencies with v1 vs v3 of library
Martin: some reverse engineering of hash
Farina will review
Update on --name flag https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7345 [Farina]
Farina: lots of charts use this - we can make it a hidden flag
Fisher: Helm 3‚Äôs refactoring of argument/flag parsing is less complex so this is more straightforward for the CLI - we still have to look at the SDK (might be okay)
Farina: we‚Äôre less worried about the SDK and more about copypasta
3tutorials
Taylor: let‚Äôs be careful of precedent
Fisher: let‚Äôs assert this is a case-by-case decision, and not a precedent
Farina: a valid case exists here, and they get a deprecation message. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwe support it forever‚Äù scenario.

Discussion
Question about SA by default in `helm create`. Is it considered a good practice for every workload to run on its own SA even before RBAC resources are needed (PR where this was added), and if so, why? [Scott]:
Curious what practice why to create a SA everytime for deploy a chart
Farina said he reviewed this and he thought this pattern was being used commonly in the chart repo
No chart maintainers chimed in when Farina asked
Scott will raise an issue if it needs a change
Upgrade from failed releases: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5595 [Martin]
Several issues - releases can get into a state that can‚Äôt move on; people can be using deprecated APIs
We‚Äôll have this issue for open a while, for discussion
Jacob to add comment on how this can fail on first attempt to deploy
Reintroducing --name flag? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7345 [Farina]
Martin: we need to be cautious about deprecation now that the (metaphorical) horse has bolted - the release is out.
Marc agrees with Martin‚Äôs opinion
Farina to add a comment to the PR that we have broken compatibility which is allowed. There is a way to work on this.
Could set a precedence of adding back in deprecated items which is not a great idea
Community member would like to add Deb and RPM packages for Helm: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7003#issuecomment-577527262  [Martin]
Martin: Is this something we want? They‚Äôre talking about hosting somewhere - do we actively support this or remain neutral/they support+we link?
Farina: Hosting elsewhere could cause a trust issue depending on who - we‚Äôd want to be clear that it‚Äôs a third party
Martin: choice is between running it ourselves and pointing to a third party
Farina: Point out to them that this is third party and he is totally responsible (unless we have maintainers who want to take it on with him)
3.0.3 and 3.1.0 releases? [Farina]

Auto-completion re-written in Go https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7323 [Matt Farina]
Moving it to Go lets us remove kubectl as a dependency
Request: please take a look/review this - it‚Äôs a big change
Fisher will be taking a look & put it on the 3.1 milestone
What should be done about the version on master? "unreleased" is currently not being added [Marc]
Marc was unsure how to post a version to show something would be off master - like ‚Äú3.0 unreleased‚Äù like it used to.
Fisher explains he & Adam refactored the internal version packaging so the stable release would not have ‚Äúunreleased‚Äù hardcoded
Fisher: In the makefile there‚Äôs a way to specify ‚Äúunreleased‚Äù when not being built from a tag - we should add that (back).
Action item for Fisher: open an issue explaining the problem and suggested solution
Handle CRD ingress resources https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5574 [Matt Farina provided feedback]
Farina commented on this last May but uncertain why it‚Äôs on this list today
Martin added it today, to see if we can give a more complete answer now
Farina says we need more eyes on work that will affect CRDs - they‚Äôre still challenging
community charts Helm 3 backwards compatibility is complete (to the best of our knowledge). Does anyone know of other issues that have since come up that aren't listed here? https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/19008 [Scott]
Fisher: that is a pretty comprehensive issue list
Hook up Linux s390x as CI platform: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7096 [Martin]
Submitter was asking about hooking a particular test into our CI pipeline
Farina mentions github actions and ‚Äúself-hosted runners‚Äù as an option
Martin wonders if we _want_ this to be automated
Fisher points out that the ARM architecture testing was hosted by a third-party community project (without official support) - could we have the community members who are interested in s390x do the testing?
Martin mentions that we aren‚Äôt automatically running other platforms‚Äô tests either.
Fisher: the same argument can be made for PPC arch
Butcher: the problem with new architectures: we cannot guarantee reliability on archs that the core team can‚Äôt access
Farina: so, we document to avoid confusion
K8s 1.16 and deprecated APIs: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7219 [Martin]
Martin: This is going to be a big issue for people in production
A community member might work on a plugin for this (like the helm 2to3 plugin)
This is going to be messy - there‚Äôs no clean delineation
Fisher: other issues like migration of one chart from an older to newer api version - k8s upgrades objects from 1.15 to 1.16, so making it easier for release objects would be good
Farina: other issues are coming - helm upgrade *should* allow All The Things to work (if we can find a way)
Bridget: can we recommend replace instead of upgrade?
Fisher: we should look at the k8s strategy for API version upgrades - this is going to happen with ingress and more
Martin: we‚Äôll keep an eye on this

Discussion
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6752 needs some reviews [Taylor]
We should discuss its behavior with `helm template`
Butcher: the right thing to do is to throw errors vs. default values
Taylor: are we ok w/ this?
FIsher: curious if this solves anyones issues
Taylor: maybe post-render is the better option
Martin: we may not want this capability
Taylor: this feels like --wait - took 2 years to make it work properly, so we should be cautious
Bridget: lets not surprise people in unpleasant ways
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7260 [Taylor]
Updates on this proposal
Need to decide on how long we should leave open for comment
Fisher: Is there a precedent in other orgs (python) for long features left open for discussion?
Post-render hooks - the ability to add in extra resources after the fact
Bridget: ‚Äúwe are putting the burden of repeatability on the end user to ensure they are using the correct post-renderer every time‚Äù is this going to be okay given sufficient docs?
Taylor: will probably leave open for 2 weeks
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7320 [Taylor]
When migrating from 2 to 3, when moving CRDs to crd/ directory, their CRDs will be deleted.
We‚Äôve always said (in docs etc.) we will not delete CRDs

Taylor‚Äôs post-render proposal
Specify a binary with --post-renderer=<bin> on install
The binary must take stdin and return kubernetes yaml on stdout
If you opt-into a post-render, you‚Äôre stuck with it for the release‚Äôs lifetime
Will remove checks on if a release used post-renderer for now, will add in later as feature if needed
Need review from other maintainers

Helm 3.0.1 has been released
Standup
Marc: Improvements to completion -- in Cobra itself. It will be a surprise!
Josh: Introducing Peter, who will be working with Josh. Chart Museum 0.10 is incompatible with Helm 3, so working on upgrading it.
Fisher: ONE BAZILLION ISSUES TRIAGED. Pass through old support questions that were stale
Taylor: Backlog on issues and PRs. Next week: Proposal for post-render hooks with Replicated. Example with Kustomize coming soon.
Farina: 3.0.1 released, then at Kubernetes Forum in Seoul doing a Helm presentation.
Butcher: Discovery client bug, PR triaging
Martin: Working through the PR queue, and triaging issues
Community:
Anukul: Issue #3276 (external files to chart deployments). Can we discuss here?  https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3276
Sandip: Second time on the call, and interested in contributing as well.
Scott (chat): PS sorry I was late for standup everyone, one thing I think I should at least mention is that Reinhard & I have been working on Chart Repo automation actions:
Demo: https://github.com/helm/charts-repo-actions-demo (intended to not only demo and test the actions, but help chart maintainers how to easily become chart repo maintainers in a few easy steps)
@helm/kind-action
@helm/chart-testing-action
@helm/chart-releaser-action
Discussion
#3276: Proposed possible implementation. Pass in files from a commandline flag, then a template can access those particular files if they were passed in.
Fisher: Can we have the user opt-in to including files at install time so that the user is totally aware of what files are added
Anukul: Yeah, we can talk about this offline
‚ÄúLookup‚Äù function: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6752 [Taylor]
Ability to look up data from inside the cluster during template rendering
Need to vet security of this
Josh: How does this handle the (offline) ‚Äòhelm template‚Äô case?
Taylor: We should follow up on that in the issue
‚Äúhelm env and XDG_* vars‚Äù https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6892 [Marc]
Marc: Was hoping Adam would be here. Will continue on the issue queue.
Next Cobra release will print the help text on stderr.  Any foreseen issue? [Marc]
Change that causes all help text to go to stderr
Marc: Could bring it up in Cobra as a breaking change?
Fisher (chat): Should look into whether this is configurable in Cobra itself

What versions of Kubernetes is Helm supporting? [mattfarina]
Note, Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS ship n-2 as their latest stable
Example: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6590
If we stick with n-1 we‚Äôd be excluding all public cloud providers
All maintainers present in the call are ok with n-2. Farina is going to send out an email to Helm Maintainers for a vote
How should Helm v3 cache work? [martin]
In v3, repository file (repositories.yaml) seems to be empty for cache property for repo entries
The repositories.yaml file is missing the cache property.
This is different per system due to the XDG spec, which allows you to change which directory to look in. Caching should still work
Adam is going to look it up to validate
When migrate from v2 to v3, repository cache is not updated in repo file following `helm repo update` https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6488#issuecomment-539468075
Helm test and hooks roadmap for v3 release [jacob]
See presentation for full proposal
There is an open PR to remove the cleanup command
Hooks will be recreated (idempotent) by default and other resources will be updated as needed
Helm 2.x and 3.x [martin]
When going to release Beta 5?
Beta.5 is following the same roadmap as beta.4 (which was released due to a needed security patch)
We are waiting for beta.5 until 2.15 is released
Do we lock down merges until we have new branches available?
Branch names post 2.15 release? For example, master ‚Üí 2.x, dev-v3 ‚Üí master & dev-v3 ‚Üí 3.0 (3.0 GA)
Dates:
2.15 RC today or tomorrow
2.15 by next wednesday
Switch branches right after 2.15 (shoot for thursday)
Beta.5 will be released before branch cut over (shoot for thursday)
We‚Äôll cut the v3 RC as soon as we are ready after that so we have a longer RC time for people to try it in prod

helm template refactor and remove dependency on install. Ideas on how to go about it.
Action item: open up a WIP PR so we can give some actionable feedback
Moving initActionConfig to pkg: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6341 from aaronmell (Note: We set up the expectation this would get in, and the submitter is asking.)
Adam: I can give an update on this one
Fix chartutil.Save returning empty path when passing a non-existent directory (Resolves #6344): https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6360 from wxdao (Note: We told the submitter this bugfix would get considered; actively working on it today.)
Overall, I think we need to step in and respond, telling them that we need to
feat(cmd/helm): use alternative ports on `helm init`: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5847 from mnkyl (Note: This is Tiller-related but seems ready for review. So we either merge or reject now, it seems.)
Fisher will look at this.
fix repo url being decoded: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6060 from karuppiah7890 (Note: Looks like the submitter is hoping for a review and actively working on it.)
Matt Farina: I‚Äôve already commented and they‚Äôre asking for me. I‚Äôll look at it.
add AppVersion column to the history command: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5069 from adshmh (Note: Is there a reason this is not merged, other than the docs conflict that crept in over time? Looks like it needs a second maintainer to look at it?)
Matt Farina: I‚Äôll take a look at this one
Taylor: I can port to v3 when done

v2.15 [Taylor]
Current plan is this will be the last feature release (we could then close all v2 _feature_ PRs - bugs will still get worked, just not ‚Äúexciting new thing‚Äù.
Helm channels: Slack, mailing list, etc - letting people know
We will probably have to stay on current client go libraries until k8s 1.17 comes out.
v3 label, project board, etc (Bridget)
What does ‚Äú bacongobbler added the v3 label 3 days ago‚Äù imply? The Helm 3 project board has a small subset of what‚Äôs tagged v3. The v3 label on PRs does not seem to imply it will be merged _before_ v3.
Farina: ‚ÄúV3‚Äù as a label doesn‚Äôt imply any commitment
Fisher: Github has a feature that allows one to add description for labels - let‚Äôs add more info to the v3 label. And let‚Äôs update the contributing docs.
Farina + Adam: let‚Äôs flag everything v2 or v3
 timeboxed segment where we look at outstanding issues/PRs
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6504 - technically a breaking change - but we said beta could have those! So it should be okay?
Farina will add some labels for v2/v3

Marckhouzam: auto-completion for the v2/v3 migration https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6474
What is the priority? Adam appreciates and will review.
But should v2 patches get added so autocomplete works properly on both sides?
Josh D: if autocomplete is not working it‚Äôs a bug
Matt Farina: Happy to review these.

Edge case issue https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6435 [martin]:
If Helm 2 and Helm 3 manage the same cluster concurrently
And Helm 2 release data is stored as secrets in the cluster
And Helm 2 has release(s) stored in namespace of the release
Helm 3 stores release as secret in the namespace of release
Helm 3 will not list any such v2 releases as different labels used
With Helm 3 you can try to install with name already used in v2 and it errors out
Issues also occurs for migrating data meaning that release cannot be migrated
Should Helm 3 to use a different naming convention for release versions?
Are we still integrating new functionality into v2 like https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5704? [martin]

Bridget: getting ready for Open Source Summit talk about Helm 3
Adam: code reviews, pairing, helm init feature (lazy-creating config files and system directories as needed)

Discussion
CRDs in Helm 3 [Taylor and Adam]
Taylor: ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs favorite topic in k8s-land - CRDs!‚Äù
As we factor out how manifests are rendered, there isn‚Äôt a clear path/common use/install/manage pattern for CRDs
Farina: CRDs allow you to extend the k8s API, so they‚Äôre good for cluster extensions, but they need more access than you usually want to give to app developers. Lack of definition in the space about how this should work - but we‚Äôre using CRDs far beyond their original intents, and in many enterprise environments, installing an operator is a cross-team administrative task. Also, across namespaces may not work as expected (is the CRD available?)
Farina: Helm v3 likely can‚Äôt ‚Äúsolve‚Äù things that are still beta in k8s itself.
Adam: Helm can‚Äôt validate API objects in the cluster, due to order-of-operations - before we can parse a CRD object we have to render the manifests, and then you can create API resources that weren‚Äôt available when you did the rendering - we can‚Äôt render before we install. Possible solution: break out CRDs into a defined space in the chart? And then CRD management happens first, so the rest of the rendering then works correctly?
Butcher: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also that peculiar pattern where the controller installs its CRD. Then we can‚Äôt load CRD instances until the controller is running‚Ä©‚Äù
Taylor: Making assumptions in Helm 2 that turned out to be invalid means we‚Äôre looking to the community to ensure we go the direction they want (instead of trying to impose a standard).
Adam: projects wanting clean install steps are interested in answers on CRDs, but application operations is where the problems show up.
Farina: a human way to make the experience of interacting with this better - better error messages, better docs
Bridget: good point - if people have to choose between ‚Äúhello world is easy‚Äù and ‚Äúproduction is safe‚Äù the answer is clear, but it would be nice to have both.
Farina: let‚Äôs help people understand how to use Helm in production
Vibhav: we don‚Äôt want people to use CRDs by mistake or without understanding them.

Helm v3 charts, is it time to increment the chart apiVersion to v2?
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5907
Example changes:
requirements.lock now Chart.lock
Requirements now in Chart.yaml
Michelle has proposed a chart test breaking change
Release object in templates has changed (Time dropped but sprig function coming to templates to return exact same feature in use)
Someone is working on a Helm v3 controller - https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5994
https://github.com/fluxcd, too
Are the changes to the test architecture documented somewhere (proposal? v3*.md?).
Any updates on planning for Lua engine stuff? (curious about chart template post-render options. No rush üòÖ)
Answer: other Helm v3 features are prioritized to get out for initial helm release, breaking changes etc, and most importantly Tillerless. Lua can be an upcoming MINOR version, and work can start at some point after the initial v3 release.

Need a label or a way to assign community members to issues (michelle)
Was talking to someone in the community about an issue, and she wanted to take over the issue, but there was no way to assign it to them.
Need to look into what administrative controls GitHub has for this?
Will look into what k8s does here and should have an update soon
Community member asking when alpha.2 is scheduled for (martin)
(Find alpha.2 issue to add here)
We‚Äôre working on this as hard as possible. We‚Äôve deferred features to post 3.0 (e.g. LUA) so that we can get the critical pieces out. E.g. atomic flag, 3-way diff, etc. Might be a couple of months. We are trying to get a release out the door for this.
Helm Testing Proposal:
[Martin] Brought up backwards compatibility; what happens in cases of test success/failure (ideally failure keeps resources around, success cleans up -- or this can be based on a flag).
[Michelle] Conditionals become hairy and hard to understand -- so maybe having a seperate cleanup command is good here? Maybe this needs more discussion -- let‚Äôs open an issue up on this. How much of this is based on the cleanup flag? What if we have a seperate cleanup action (e.g. && cleanup) that we can do explicitly.
[Jacob] Re test cleanup: https://github.com/helm/community/pull/90#discussion_r297374923
The second test proposal is based on a lot of feedback and conversations. The first one should be closed shortly.
Lots of people are using this very often, and is very popular -- so thanks for driving this Michelle!
[Michelle] Current implementation just has to have the right annotation, doesn‚Äôt need to have the tests in the templates test directory -- this has an implication on backwards compatibility.

Helm 3 OCI: enforcement of tags (joshua)
OCI does not have a ruleset on the tag pushed
The current context in Helm is to not push non-semver tags
Do we want to allow semver-incompatible tags?
(fisher and farina) if we do support those, then it makes the dependency resolution problem much harder
If there‚Äôs enough demand, perhaps we should come up with a proposal to the UX so we can capture that use case
New docs: https://v3.helm.sh/docs/developing_charts/#registries
PR reviews (matt and adam)
Current status: Helm 2 requires 2 LGTMs on PRs size/L or higher. Helm 3 requires 2 LGTMs on *all* PRs
How do we get more people to jump in on PR reviews?
What can we do to incentivize folks to review PRs?
Taylor: perhaps it‚Äôs not the PR review itself, but the lack of coverage on tests that are causing blocks on PR reviews? Could we implement some form of acceptance test suite?
Action item: farina to bring it back to the mailing list?
Should we cut 2.14.2 when this PR lands? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5532 (Taylor)

Action item: fisher to bring it to the core maintainers mailing list
v2 release object from state not loading in v3 (martin)
This is in relation to the release object stored in the namespace, not the rendering engine itself
Part of it is because we were encoding the gRPC protobuf. Once that was removed, we are now only encoding the JSON object. For example, enums
If we‚Äôre planning on migrating Helm release objects from Helm 2 to Helm 3, we should work on a migration plugin that reads old release objects and spits out Helm 3 release objects.
Action item: it‚Äôs suggested to write a proposal on how the complexities between the differences between Helm 2 and Helm 3‚Äôs object metadata and a planned proposal for moving forward (martin)

Unsetting values keys for Helm 3: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5834
How do we want to address this? Deprecation or remove it?
Farina: how would you unset it in a values.yaml file?
Adam: when you set a value, that value is persisted throughout the release history. If it‚Äôs explicitly set as `nil`, then we can explicitly check for new values
A simple example of this is probes. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly common to unset values for execute vs http probes
If time, check in about Lua chart post-render overrides (Scott)

Features added to Helm 3 project board so community can help deliver Helm 3 release [martin]
Created this so folks can pick up features off the board and work on it.
Board is at: https://github.com/helm/helm/projects/1
Core things that we want to get done now; can build on top of it later (e.g. XDG directory changes will break compat, but will be good) We have a window to get changes in that have a potential to be backwards incompatible.
Signing and container repos [matt farina]
How do we go about sticking charts in container repos
Provenance file has hash of package, signed using gpg keys
Container repos don‚Äôt necessarily have the same hash in different container repos (e.g. docker-distribution, quay, etc.)
Interesting conversation with OCI folks: Why does the hash change across container registries. There is the index, and the container layers + metadata. The index changes over time, but the content is unchanged? Radu has been looking at this as well for CNAB (how do we sign the bundle and get one signature that we can use to verify across repositories).
How does this work with tuf and notary?
We have alternatives to GPG keys as well -- some folks want to use PKI instead.
Helm is different in one way -- you can sign locally and upload the chart and provenance separately. This is because the hash doesn‚Äôt contain the name of the repository. Could also look into some of the other things like hierarchical key distribution vs. flat.
Registry things undiscussed [josh]
This is a longer discussion, so probably a better idea to schedule a 30+ minute slot to hash this out.
Play with bundle.bar -- there are now ~600 charts
2.14 + Azure issue? [josh]
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5788
Issue where helm keeps logging out when login is done with az-cli

Karen is looking to do more with our community blog. We‚Äôd like to make it easier to contribute blog post topics. PR #84 is a place to start. It adds a document that people can us to contribute blog post topics. We can iterate on this process and create a full fledge form, blog contribution guide. Thoughts? (Michelle)
Seems like a good approach
Michelle to chat again with Karen
Some topic raised in community (Martin):
Multiple environment best practices
Micro-services best practices
History/state stored details
We should create a helm org maintainers mailing list if that‚Äôs not already a thing and publish it on the communication doc of the Helm community repo so people know where to have discussions around cross cutting topics that concern the helm community and github org. (Michelle)
(fisher) I believe this already exists, we just need to document it: cncf-helm-maintainers@lists.cncf.io
(michelle) that is for helm core maintainers I believe. We need one just for org maintainers in case people higher order concerns and concerns across multiple projects. I don‚Äôt see where the cncf-helm-maintainers mailing list info is published. We should also make the goal of the mailing lists clearer.
cncf-helm-core-maintainers@lists.cncf.io is for core maintainers, but cncf-helm-maintainers is for org maintainers. It‚Äôs a little unclear for sure

We could have a github project board for ‚Äúroles‚Äù that we need. i.e. ‚Äúsomeone to triage helm 2 issues‚Äù, ‚Äúsomeone to triage helm 3 issues‚Äù, someone to help with release management‚Äù, ‚Äúsomeone to help us figure out a  release planning process‚Äù, etc. Kubernetes has a role board for this.

$schema in values for json schema? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5350#issuecomment-485852606

What‚Äôs the process for creating new slack channels now that we‚Äôre part of the CNCF? [fisher]
For context, Helm is now part of the CNCF. There exists a CNCF Slack, but Helm slack channels still exist in the Kubernetes slack.
We have not had to create a channel since the CNCF migration, but Scott Rigby wants to create a channel for helm/chart-releaser
Lachie mentioned last time he checked in January, the CNCF slack is only for CNCF related business and temporary channels on an ad-hoc basis
CNCF projects like OPA and Kubernetes should manage and maintain their own Slack workspace
Fisher will ask Scott to ask the Kubernetes org if they‚Äôll create a channel for him

Make crd-install hook idempotent [mattfarina]
Charts repo is seeing issue from this
Error if the content is different on first pass
In the future we could discuss a flag that allows overwriting if different
Was also proposed over on https://github.com/helm/community/pull/64
Discussion:
Make CRD hook idempotent -- could this be a problem? Should work, but the trick is deleting the CRDs. Case where 2 things install the same CRD => we should be able to achieve this including for Helm3.
(Adnan) built a workaround
Helm 3 status update [fisher] üëà
https://github.com/helm/helm/projects/1
The goal is to understand what are the things we are quantifying for an alpha release of Helm 3.
Paired with core-maintainers to figure out what should be in an alpha release. What we have currently, and what we would like to have in there.
When we go through this backlog, we should be able to cut an alpha release.
Feedback / Comments:
This is awesome! Thanks!
Changes with Helm 3 fall into different buckets. E.g. LUA, repo, tillerless, etc. Does it make sense to make labels for these bigger ‚Äúthemes‚Äù.
Might be difficult to do since lines are sometime blurred between components. E.g. refactoring of the engine piece.
This would help with filtering by theme -- especially as we add more items to the board. There might be a parallel with SIGs, perhaps?
This might be a good thing to add at some point later perhaps when we go from alpha => beta.
(fisher / josh) Let‚Äôs table the discussion for now and revisit this once we are a bit further along.
#helm slack channel moderators, we need them [mattfarina]
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/moderation.md
We‚Äôre in k8s Slack and they are looking for moderators.
Especially in EMEA / APAC region time-zones.
Don‚Äôt need to necessarily need be core maintainers. It would be good if anyone in the community can be Slack moderators.
Request for feedback on resource policy PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/5092
Has to do with deleting manifests.
Call to folks who understand this space to comment.
First commit is what‚Äôs changing in the application logic.
There might have been some uncaught changes -- so might be good to run some manual tests. Fisher will have some time to hopefully take this on last week.

Helm v3 status https://github.com/helm/helm/projects/1
Discussion
Could we recap our approach to how we handle v2 fixes while the v3 branch is not yet accepting fixes (or maybe it is accepting them?). Is there a list of fixes waiting to be merged? Is there a tag that we should apply to v2 fixes that need to be ported across later? Etc. etc. (henrynash)
We need a clear policy...which is that v3 IS accepting fixes.
New label: #needs-v3-fix

CRD lifecycle - Helm and deleting CRDs (doesn‚Äôt today) and CRD lifecycle [mattfarina]
The crd-install hook only deals with the install lifecycle but there are open issues IRT CRDs with Helm. How should we approach this?
Adam: we don‚Äôt do lifecycle management around CRDs because CRDs can be shared across multiple charts, so if we delete a CRD on a `helm delete`, then we could delete a CRD that could be dependent on other charts
James: I agree, but with the introduction of the annotation, we‚Äôve seen weird behaviour where if someone has created a CRD prior to a `helm install`, the CRD will get removed before being installed. We‚Äôre trying to figure out what we can do to make the situation better for istio/cert-controller
Adam: I haven‚Äôt dug too deep into the CRD APIs, but perhaps an action item we can do is observe the behaviour how the Kubernetes API handles CRDs outside of Helm, and determine the expected behaviour? Perhaps even a few concrete use cases
Mortent: would it be valuable to add a proposal for the solution in Helm 3?
James and Adam: yeah, this might affect Helm 3 as well so if there are fixes that need to happen there we should get that in
At IBM we have several hundred charts, and I hear this issue of CRD quite a lot - I‚Äôll do a review and see if I can bring requirements to the table [henrynash]
<heresy>Given the increasing agenda length, if we are going to stick to a 30min call, maybe we should skip the Standup section?</heresy> [henrynash]
Adam: should we talk about this in 2 weeks at next standup?
Henry - happy with that
Given we are entering a period of large new features for helm, would it be beneficial to formally articulate/document how new features should be agreed for inclusion? Many open source projects have a spec repo (e.g.: https://github.com/openstack/keystone-specs), where the PR for a spec getting merged means that the feature and its architectural implementation is agreed. I guess our equivalent is the helm/community/proposals|helm-v3 ? However, it is not clear how such things really get accepted, what‚Äôs the threshold for sign off by maintainers etc. [henrynash] (let‚Äôs defer this to 2 weeks time)

Helm v3 repository topics [jdolitsky]
Community proposal #55 - merging helm repos and docker registries
The basis of this proposal is for helm repositories to mimic the docker registry API more closely
Looking on what is the right way to build it out further
Jimmy: the problem I see is the backwards compatibility for the pre-existing repository system (referring to Helm 2 repositories)
Fisher: the other issue comes in the form of OCI mediaType incompatibility (you can‚Äôt helm push quay.io/bacongobbler/helloworld and docker push quay.io/bacongobbler/helloworld)
The quay implementation restricts repositories to a single mimetype to avoid this problem, but that has UX tradeoffs

Helm container image? What base image (scratch, alpine, etc?) [Matt Farina]
Tiller uses alpine, so we should probably re-use that

Linkerd2 has a different way to inject sidecars. How can we do this with Helm today? [Matt Farina]
Adam: yeah, I don‚Äôt think we could accommodate this today, essentially linkerd2 needs to stream-edit the chart as it‚Äôs being applied

(adam) I‚Äôm currently looking at sharing some documentation around what‚Äôs changed, possible opening a github project to show what‚Äôs being worked on/what‚Äôs done/what‚Äôs in the backlog
Markdown docs are stale in dev-v3, so updating the README or jumping into existing project work (docs site, CI infra, repository API working group)

Encrypting secrets for sites and services [Matt Farina]
Org maintainers - congrats! You are now responsible for the following [Josh]:
Maintaining the mission, vision, values, and scope of the project
What is it that Helm trying to solve? (mission)
Where does Helm start and end? (scope)
How will we get there? (vision)
What do we need to embrace in order to succeed? (values)
Refining the governance and charter as needed
What can we do to make this process ultra-efficient?
How do move fast and not break things?
Making project level decisions
How can we make sure people have necessary info in order to confidently vote?
Which type of decisions are made at the subproject level? (eg. choice of CI, language, etc.)
Resolving escalated project decisions when the subteam responsible is blocked
What are the respective subteams?
Who will be primary points of contact for each?
Managing the Helm brand
Websites, logos
Documentation
Tutorials and evangelism
Twitter, social media, etc.
?
Controlling access to Helm assets such as source repositories, hosting, project calendars
Which tools will we use managing and sharing credentials?
Handling code of conduct violations
Violators will be publicly executed with a 2/3 vote
Deciding what sub-groups are part of the Helm project
Should this divide into more than just subprojects? (eg. testing committee)
Overseeing the resolution and disclosure of security issues
Majority of issues would related to Kubernetes in Helm 3
Does CNCF have a process in place for this?
Managing financial decisions related to the project
What types of things might cost money?
How does being a CNCF project relate to this?
Can companies or individuals contribute?
How can we ensure that the direction of the project cannot be ‚Äúbought‚Äù?

Discussion
Chart packaging system improvements (@gintas) Please see https://hackmd.io/Q8dyCyztRmW4_Xz9UFwuMQ
Farina: what about the forking model? If you fork the chart and not change the ID (an implied change of this proposal), which cached version wins? You‚Äôve got a non-reproducible cache pollution issue.
The question becomes ‚Äúhow do we do caching/forking with this model?‚Äù
We could run a hash on the chart and map it to that, perhaps
Josh: hashing may be a problem with relative file path links in requirements.yaml (charts can change on disk)
Farina: I‚Äôm not seeing what particular problems this proposal is trying to solve. Is there a human-readable write-up on the problem at-hand?
Action item: reach out and follow up with @gintas on the core problem without trying to come up with a solution
https://quay.io/helmpack/chart-testing/ is now public and we are archiving logs for long term via https://github.com/mattfarina/query-store-quay-logs (to be moved to the helm org after elections). But, only archiving aggregated stats (e.g., total pulls per day) rather than details because detailed as usernames mapped to IPs and other data. Thoughts?
Fisher: does the CNCF have any policies/thoughts on statistics for CNCF projects (e.g. any policies that came out of devstats.cncf.io)?
Farina: good question. I‚Äôll follow up with them
Adam and Matt: probably good to just track general trendlines rather than deep personal data on users.
Josh: can we move the ChartMuseum image over to the quay repository?
Farina: yeah!
Travis Foster: hey, I‚Äôve been looking into JSON parsers for Helm 3

Estimating the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow
Bumped to next week
Should we use something like https://github.com/ericchiang/k8s instead of client-go for helm v3? (Farina)
Client-go has some well known pain points
Butcher: is it still being maintained?
Not sure
Would it be practical to use an alternative client to client-go in helm 3?
Butcher tried it. His findings:
Pervasive change
Eric made some really insightful changes but that create a somewhat cumbersome experience
For example, pointer to all the fields
This is the approach that apache thrift took
To use this library, some things are more cumbersome for the user
Some parts of the library didn‚Äôt feel 100% done
Pros: dep ensure took like 5 seconds
Adam: what is driving this?
Farina: Making upgrades easier. This is the time to make breaking changes, so let‚Äôs entertain the idea.
Adam: will take a look at it this week
Docker Hub vs alternatives for public image distribution (Farina)
On the charts side, we are going to distribute the chart testing library. Been thinking about where is the right place to store it and point people to.
Went out on the email list
Butcher: DOCKERHUB
Quay will tell us if there are vulnerabilities
Michelle: security is nice. Cool.
Fisher: DockerHub seems to be ubiquitous
Deis Workflow had a tough time trying to figure out metrics like image download count. Didn‚Äôt know if it was actually accurate.
Metrics not a blocker if the discoverability is the primary driver for this.
What is the best place to store images to get metrics?
Metadata points in ACR but it‚Äôs not public so it‚Äôs not an option

There are a ton of edge cases around the different merge strategies
Farina: what about server-side apply?
Adam: same problem, it would be a very large technical challenge to manage different upgrade strategies for Helm 2
Discussion
Question: how does helm plan to address auto-generated configuration on `helm install`? E.g. autogenerated passwords in the postgres chart
Farina: we should come up with a convention.
Butcher: I would guess doing a pre-install hook to install a Configmap to autogenerate a password and place it in there
DCO?
Butcher: DCOs require all commits need to be signed?
Adam and Farina: yes
https://github.com/mattfarina/brigade-test-project/pull/1
https://github.com/probot/dco
Farina: asking michelle if they can pair on this on Monday?
Michelle: yes
Helm v3 or hub: enforce or notify if immutability changed?
Farina: if the digest changes, should we notify if someone broke
This is referring to changing an existing chart in-place, not bumping the version
Michelle in chat: then yes, we should put a warning in
Adam: the one thing we may want to think about is when charts are in development.
Farina: we could do a digest diff on a `helm repo update`?
Farina: we should probably think this one through
‚Äúhelm login‚Äù - How do we envision this to work? Anybody interested in a call to address this in detail?
Josh will put out an email to discuss this topic
Butcher: can we start on the next Helm release since k8s 1.11 support is done and we have a few minor features committed already?
Fisher: sure
Butcher: there‚Äôs a lot of people asking for it, so we should cut an RC
Taylor: we should go through the PR queue before we cut an RC as there‚Äôs been a few requests

Longer meeting? Should we start 30 min earlier?
Are we letting meetings run long because we don‚Äôt do well time-boxing items, or do we just have a lot of agenda items.
There seems to be more material to discuss. With Helm 3 and the hub, there is more ‚Äústuff‚Äù to discuss.
Should https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/4473 be thrown into the release branch and cut rc.4, or cut v2.10.0 without it?

Working on update notifications -- how to tell folks that they have a helm update for them.
Discussion
Can folks (non core-maintainers) add/remove labels on the helm/helm repo right now? (michelle)
Non-core shouldn‚Äôt have access to do this.
There used to be a bot that we could use. The automation in place used to be able to allow folks to do this, but it was k8s specific.
Helm proposals
Installing custom plugin sets:
(Taylor) Two thumbs up
How do we do version handling? How do we discover the version.
(Butcher) It might be good to not even handle versions for a first pass
Helm v2 repositories
https://github.com/helm/community/pull/27
Two file approach -- idea is to do this to improve performance so that we‚Äôre able to do a lazy fetch
If you use a relative URL, don‚Äôt you lose context of the base URL?
If you have it in more than one URL the relative URL works across http / https.
Are we going to host keywords / maintainers from the current charts repo into the top-level file? How do we consider what is latest? (eg. 5.1.3 vs 5.1.4-alpha1).
We might want to change it from ‚Äúlatest‚Äù to ‚Äústable‚Äù to address this
Improved signing
https://github.com/helm/community/pull/20
Generate GPG keys for you so that you can sign charts (default is on). Move closer to making verification a part of the helm repo experience.
Main thing here is whether storing the public key is okay to store in the charts or not.
We don‚Äôt need to take an external dependency on GPG -- go already has libs that we use (already in the code).

Governance
Matt Farina's proposal for a new governance structure
https://hackmd.io/s/B1BksVYW7#
Bootstrapping process for project maintainer elections
Still need to figure out how to do this fairly and equally
Project maintainers need to be codebase maintainers
A codebase maintainer may not want to/be suitable to be a project maintainer
Codebase maintainers have skin in the game and care about the project direction
Codebase maintainers don't need to be software engineers, Helm has a history of maintainers that didn't contribute software but have contributed in other ways
Experience matters here, want ideas and psychology to bubble up to project maintainership
Don't want to end up with top-down maintainership
Sub-projects have a lot of freedom in adding maintainers - simple majority vote
Action: Make it more explicit that codebase maintainers don't need to be software engineers
Okay to have an even number of project maintainers for a short amount of time, if someone steps down before replacement found
Maintainers only removed if they become unresponsive
Bootstrapping project maintainers
Different weights for different projects?
Ghost period for code maintainers should be shorter?
Set an upper limit, but let codebases choose lower limits if desired

Farina:
Notifications: Working on how we can notify people when new versions of Helm are out. Using mini-kube as a model for this.
Verification work with the proxy (using kubeapps model). This is interesting especially with the multi-tiller approach that most people use.
Lots of emails around governance
Discussion
Moving docs [Matt Farina]
Docs repo?
Currently docs live in the helm repo itself.
Would be nice to add translation, etc.
Keeping this in mind does it make sense to move docs to their own repo?
Markdown vs Asciidoc:
Conversation with a few other folks about this:
Markdown is more popular, asciidoc is more technical?
There are tools that can switch between the two.
Example of kube-builder http://book.kubebuilder.io
Nice to be able to do side-by-side code and docs.
Built in i18n with gitbook
[Taylor]: In support of moving the docs to own repo
[Michelle] Helm v2 vs v3 docs -- will they live in the same repo in different directories?
Docker compose does a good job of splitting out the docs for different versions.
Gitbook vs other tool? https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/4100
Multi-lingual
K8s recommended labels. Do we switch? When? https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8703 [Matt Farina]
Helm has standard labels, almost one:one with the ones listed here, but having different names.
What is the best way to proceed here?
Adding annotations makes sense, but labels changes people‚Äôs deployments so the change is more intensive.
Governance esp w.r.t related projects:
Separation of concerns project maintainers vs. codebase maintainers
CNCF projects are expected to follow standard set of CI / Automation practices. (https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en) We will probably need to get to a certain state on this in the future.

Discussion on k8s 1.11 support for Helm
Update on current state of k8s 1.11 backwards incompatibilities
Generated Go code in k8s/k8s has been removed, making it unusable as a package: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62432
Removed the client-side reaper in favour of the server-side reaper. Because Helm prior releases, we need that for 1.10 support
The entire factory/builder packages in kubernetes/kubernetes were rewritten and are totally different between 1.10 and 1.11
The printer was rewritten and requires significant refactoring
Proposal (adam): due to backwards incompatibility and significant engineering effort, I propose Helm 2 only supports Kubernetes 1.10, punting k8s 1.11 to Helm 3
Another option: remove k8s/k8s as a dependency, and vendor the k8s 1.10 code directly into Helm 2 as a crutch
Apparently service catalog has already gone with this approach
Butcher: (giving some context on kube-lego and cert-manager) I don‚Äôt think we should go with solution 1. It puts our community in a bad position: Helm 3 isn‚Äôt ready, and Helm 2 would be in limbo
Adam: ok, I can go take a look at forking kubernetes/kubernetes so we have the packages for handling backwards compatibility
Farina: I‚Äôm going to take these issues up to SIG Architecture and SIG Release
Michelle (in chat): you think we should bring this up in SIG apps and see what other tools might be struggling with changes from this kubernetes release?
Farina: on the agenda for next SIG Apps
Fisher: Do we want to have a strategy for communication with the community for this? Farina: Better to over-communicate than under.
Adam: Go/no-go by end of the week. Farina: based on this we can craft some messaging to the community next week.

Come up with an announcement on the helm-users mailing list on if we‚Äôre adding 1.11 support
Helm 3 tickets
There‚Äôs been a few tickets raised on Helm 3 topics; are we ready for these?
Answer: no, redirect users to #helm-dev or the helm/community proposals at this point
Things are expected to break (and break often); we‚Äôre not ready feedback until the first alpha release
Zoom issues - people on hold?
The meeting moderator now needed to allow folks explicitly into the meeting, and folks are on hold until the moderator allows them in
Farina: Default k8s settings for zoom are changing to make things much more restrictive, and moderators need to explicitly let people in. This is around the push to stop bad actors, but meeting chairs need to keep an eye out for folks trying to join.
It might be effective to have co-hosts so that we can have multiple people keeping an eye out to let people on hold to join in.

Discussion
(Taylor) Wait-flag returning true if the app can‚Äôt start. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth it to keep the --wait flag around. Want to get input from community, and maintainers on whether it is a good idea to remove this. (Farina) On the community charts side, they had to write their own solution, but something like the wait flag is a better solution. Do understand the brittle nature of it, but it is useful. (Adam) There is a effort upstream that we might be able to piggy-back on (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64034)  -- so we might be able to leverage some of that. Maybe we should review what‚Äôs going on there, and get caught up on discussions. (Fisher) What‚Äôs the status of wait flag on v1? (Farina) There‚Äôs a storage bug that‚Äôs preventing old API versions from being removed. Hopefully that will be solved so that we don‚Äôt need to support older versions of the API / deployments? Probably a good idea to see in what direction the upstream effort is going before making an informed call here.

Proposal idea for how we want to do releases [JTT]
The dev call after the release is the next (bootstrap) call for the next release.
Each dev call have a 5/10 minute discussion for features where we discuss whether we pull merged PRs into the next release of a later release.
Is this adding unnecessary process which will be overhead for us?
Taylor will write up the process and make a PR to Helm to kick off more discussion for next week.
Distributed charts vs central hosting vs a combo [Matt Farina]
Charts Office Hours are at 9am PST 10 am Mountain on Tuesdays
Whole lot of work to curate charts and get people to curate charts and maintain. People tend to get burnt out. So the central repo model doesn‚Äôt really scale that well.
PHP packages have distributed hosting -- can we have some sort of distributed mechanism to do a similar thing for charts that is distributed, but has a central discovery -- so central metadata, with the actual charts living off in a different location.
More discussion next week
That _is_ a different project, so technically they would make a decision on this, but we should weigh-in during Charts office hours

Issue Sherpa‚Äôing with a second person was really good -- maybe we should institute a buddy system
When do we open up ‚Äòthe branch‚Äô (referring to v3 branch)?
Few things to consider - How to handle feature requests coming in.
Bugfixes, do we need to cherry-pick bugfixes into both? How do we deal with this since it looks pretty different (eg. no longer protobufs, no longer generated code, etc)
How / when do we define a freeze for Helm v2 features?
Lots of folks still using Helm 2
(Fisher) Maybe have a window (of a couple weeks or so) where we allow features for Helm 2, after which we only allow features in Helm 3. (Farina) Maybe have a cutoff date which we tell contributors about?
(Michelle) Some folks might want to continue with Helm v2 and not Helm v3.
Adam is pointing out concern for the end user vs concern for contributors.
Michelle is in favor of a helm 2 feature freeze date. Will use labels to track incoming features to make sure they get mapped to helm 3
‚Äú1. Window for getting in feature requests before the v3 requirement
2. Labeling features in Helm 2 that we need to forward-port, so we can track those‚Äù
Issue sherpas can respond to Helm 3 branch PR requests appropriately.

How do we respond to semver issues like this (Michelle)
If you use the kubeversion field and you have a constraint like >=1.8.0 this becomes incompatible with GKE‚Äôs versioning.
How do we respond / have we responded to these kinds of issues in the past.
One of the solutions was to add something like -r0 and making it pre-release (Farina might know more about this option -- this might be something that CoreOS/Rancher do)
There are over 300 open issues and over 80 open PRs. Should we do a week or two of having two sherpas to help clean out the backlog after 2.9.0 goes out? (Michelle)
(Taylor) Issues might not be much of a problem -- but we should definitely look into getting people to jump on and close PRs. The issue queue tends to self manage especially with fetja-bot and us noticing when things go stale.
(Fisher) It would be nice to make the community a bit more self-sustainable. Fully agree with prioritizing PRs over issue queue.
(Michelle) Do we want to have a dedicated person looking at PRs?
Taylor volunteered, but was decided not to make it a formal role just yet.

(Adnan) Discussion on charts collecting analytics - https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/issues/4697
Heads up that this discussion is happening - folks interested please join in at the next charts call where this will probably come up.
(Fisher) One considerations is that Helm install doesn‚Äôt have a really good way of notifying the users that some analytics are being enabled -- this is especially true especially in the case of dependent charts. (Adnan) The dependency chart might be a problem since the parent chart could set the on/off flag and users might not necessarily know about it.
(Fisher) It would be nice to make it blatantly obvious that we were turning on analytics (eg. homebrew, etc.).
(Kensey) CoreOS has one flag for all projects to turn off analytics -- would be good to standardize

Uploaders for Plugins [Josh D]
How to implement ‚Äòhelm push‚Äô
Farina: I was thinking of doing it over http/https downloaders, so that plugins can implement custom push uploaders.
Josh: See #18 on the community repo, which could also provide indexers to tackle search scale issues, maybe others.
Farina: Some survey questions are relevant to this. I‚Äôd like to keep push and index separate so that we might be able to do push in Helm 2. Index is more complex/debatable.
Josh: Maybe make chart museum method the default, and allow plugins to override
Fisher: jFrog is also interested, maybe in basic auth because that‚Äôs the only available kind

Branch naming for Helm 3 [Butcher]
Tentative plan is to have a place for Helm v3 code to land prior to KubeCon EU (beginning of May).
We had some ideas on how we want to branch for v3. Farina and Butcher looked at data and found a substantial amount of folks cloning helm master.
Normal weekday 150 - 180 unique cloners.
Points to not breaking master and leaving as is. => v3 code should live in a different branch.
‚Äòv3‚Äô is as good a name as any for the branch name.
Farina: We should think about how the branch name plays with dependency management tools like glide, dep, etc.
Butcher: Maybe we should do something like dev-v3.
Lots of suggestions for branch names in the chat -- seems that there was some consensus on dev-v3. Butcher will send a message out to the https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-kubernetes-helm list.

https://github.com/jdolitsky/community/blob/ebf12b58dec108f85c582369d937100d591f7cdc/helm-v3/006-repositories.md
Methods for authentication -- suggestion to add a helm config for authentication
(Fisher) Have we looked at different authentication models eg. pypi authentication for pip packages?
Another thing to think about is being able to auth against different repos.
This has ramifications on helm search -- you would not be able to search against multiple repos.
Do you do search locally, or do you do search against service providers? This changes the UX in subtle ways since you need to be able to search against certain repos. It would be good to know how people are actually using helm search.
This has similarities with search with pypi -- might be useful to take a look at them too.
During the transition between Helm v2 and v3, it‚Äôs really important to be able to search through existing charts and retain backwards compatibility with them.
 (Farina) Do we have concrete requirements from users? Should we go out to users and poll for requirements -- what are the differences in requirements between startups / enterprises.
(Michael Hrivnak -- Welcome!): There is a tremendous amount of value to be had to not requiring a separate service for repositories. Also for enterprise users, they will require content on site. So anything we can do to help with that will be useful.

Helm 3 Proposal
https://hackmd.io/YvQCGazPRNanSugJV-rbSg
Proposing a client-only model, tiller is gone
Internally, Helm will be restructured around events
Adam mentions notes about Lua
Lua is the easiest to embed
Brian Grant asks if they‚Äôve looked at alternatives like Skylark
Have not looked at Skylark, but they‚Äôve looked at Javascript and found some limitations with regards to constantly catching up with ECMA 6 spec, whereas Lua was designed for embedding
One appendix is to propose using the Lua engine for Helm plugins
Include a `helm push` verb to push helm charts to a repository
Talking to Josh Dolitsky and the ChartMuseum team on defining the spec for `helm push`
Farina notes there‚Äôs a lot of proposals also in the Helm issue queue. They‚Äôre not noted in the proposal, but they are not being discarded
Next steps: how to break this up into sizeable chunks/proposals
Throw in a milestone?
Move it to issues?
Dump into enhancement proposals/documentation?
Brian asks whether development would happen in the main helm repo
Lazy consensus says yes, we should have a 2.x mainline branch and run Helm 3 development on master

Last week worked hard on reviewing PRs
Moving forward on discussions on the upgrade bug, and helm init --wait. After discussions with Bryan, Adam, etc came up with solutions that were a lot cleaner that made use of grpc solutions (cool!)

Was issue sherpa this week. Thanks to others who jumped in on that.
Also worked on the v3 proposal. Tried to collect all the requirements from the Helm summit and work off of that. Polished that up and put it into documentation based on which we can have a meaningful discussion about. ‚ÄúToo much change could be a bad thing‚Äù -- Helm is kicking off, and we might not want to disrupt much. (Something to keep in mind).

Discussion
Templating in values.yaml file (see #1978, #2133, #2492, #3252, and https://image.ibb.co/k9Xo07/tpl.png)
Folks would like to go down the road of being able to templatize values.yaml files. Is there a way of going about doing something like that?
Is there a primary use-case for this? The use-cases are documented in the multiple open issues.
Adam: Maybe comes across as an anti-pattern with
One solid use case: Ability to pass the name of a parent chart to a child chart. Does it make sense to solve this use case without templatizing values.yaml?
Other use case: Want to be able to set a value in values.yaml and use that over and over again, later on.
Taylor: Maybe implement this as an alpha feature (as a plugin): if a lot of people use it and find value, maybe move forward then since that may be something that the community wants.
Fisher: Two problems: There are no standard go libs for this. Also in this case people want to render values files before sending to helm. Can we use a plugin to solve some of this (at least initially?)
Adam: It might be possible to get the info in there (eg. parent chart) in a more structured way, rather than by having to templatize values files -- the latter would likely end up with debugging FSM nightmares.
Next steps: read through the issues, to understand the use cases before we can have a deeper discussion next week. Farina will reach out to rheinhardt to get a better idea for use-cases.
Reconnect to tiller on transport error (TODO: issue number -- Farina will follow up)
There are cases where the connection to tiller gets broken. Experiencing this on chart CI and is an outstanding issue.
Suggestion: helm and tiller support a connection via a service that‚Äôs created. With CI, it‚Äôs good to set up a service and point helm to that service -- you can also use a global portforward. This might be worth looking into for CI. Default helm init might already do this -- something to check.
Another option could be to keep the tunnel open.
Does grpc have an auto-reconnect that we can use?
We see the error in less than a minute on the CI tests so it‚Äôs not very long.
E2e tests (see #2846)
Adam will take it over -- has already rebased it. A few more things to clean up. Initial rebase (#3636)
Index.yaml v2 proposal (#3557)
Farina: Can we get more eyeballs on this?
This goes hand-in-hand with the scaling discussion for chart repositories. Has implications on the growing size of the community charts repositories.
We will try and cover this a bit more during the next meeting.

Discussion
There are some bugs in 2.8
Helm list maximum client size exceeded (Justin‚Äôs case -- actually exceeding the 20 MB limit) 2.7 -> 2.8 bumped grpc, which made the client and server use the same size. Balboa has a new PR which updated the server client-receive size as well (apparently there are 3 settings that need to be updated). If this does fix it, does this warrant a 2.8.2, and if so -- do we wait until the summit to cut a 2.8.2?
Taylor / Butcher / Nikhil: Doesn‚Äôt seem like too many folks are affected by this - so probably prudent to wait until after summit.
Don‚Äôt need a dev call next week since we‚Äôll be at the summit.
Michelle will send out an announcement on the ML and _all the places_, that we are at the summit next week, so things might be a bit slow.
Taylor: Maybe we should also put a message in the dev channel that we are at the summit, in case some high-pri issues do come up. (‚ÄúEmergency mode‚Äù)

Kubernetes is going to shift away from the term ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù (eg. drupal went with primary and replica, etc.) Propose to use something like API Server / Control Plane. There are places in docs where we use the term ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù -- this needs to be updated.
Need a few more eyes on issue 3382 to figure out why upgrades are failing. Seems to be an issue with patch metadata.
We fixed a bug where we forgot to bump the version of the helm cli internally. And a couple of other bugs. Do we fix 3382 and cut a 2.8.1, or do we cut 2.8.1 without a fix for this since there are other fixes that we want to get out?
Was specifically asked to be noted that we finished 10 minutes early without MS folks around ;)

Come to a final decision on how we are going to use test-infra and any concerns we have with it

Butcher: can we version pin plugins/opt out of new features e.g. new labels introduced in the label plugin?
Farina: policy on how we roll this out is discussing right now in SIG test infra
Feedback: adding too much heavy-handed test automation is not required for smaller projects like Helm; it does not need a whole lot of tooling because the process is intentionally simple
Farina is hoping more people to come to SIG contribex to provide this feedback
Best option is to look at the plugin repo to see what we can opt in (and out) of

RBAC best practices changes
Do we create a service account for each service by default (in Tiller)?
A service account per service is a pretty good idea
There is a debate about whether or not we should have Tiller do this.

Common labels allow for some really good possibilities for visualization

Stepping down from core maintainership role gracefully: Introduce a new category for ‚Äúemeritus‚Äù where one rescinds a previously-held voting role. Open an issue in which to discuss this procedure. The Kubernetes Steering Committee has guidelines that we could borrow.
There are parties that may show up at KubeCon that will paint the Helm community in a bad light. We‚Äôve been improving the documentation in preparation.

Helping people over the istio helm chart, how to get it installed into the cluster and how to add it to your own service using istio sidecar injection
Found a bug when submitting a chart with no objects caused an error; there‚Äôs an argument forming around a chart should be installable even if no resources are deployed
Discussion topics
What other mailing lists do we need other than Kubernetes-helm-core for core team communications?
Need alias for security leaks
Justin: should we pre-seed discussion about what is on the table for breaking changes in Helm 3?
We should rope in everyone on a 45 minute dev call to discuss what‚Äôs the scope of the project for helm 3, whether charts compatibility should break between Helm 2 and Helm 3, etc.
Should we discuss about the helm summit at KubeCon?
Yes

Discussion
Helm 2.7 timeline
Butcher asks if there‚Äôs anything other than k8s 1.8 that should get in before we cut 2.7
Taylor mentions there‚Äôs the secrets backend that would be good to get in, but we‚Äôre still working on getting some documentation for that PR
Matt Farina relays community unrest around the release delay between a kubernetes release and a helm release supporting that kubernetes release
We should cut a release candidate once k8s 1.8 support is in Helm so users can test Helm on k8s 1.8 and try that out

We can mock things out like we do in tests. We would mock against the current kubernetes version we build against
Template is no longer just for debugging, but also for rendering templates. It isn‚Äôt a preferred use case, but we are ok with adding in flags to enable this functionality
Output formatting for Helm
This is a complex issue that Adam already tried
It might be cool to have, but there will be some work

Helm Commandeer

Adopt existing resources into a chart/release
Use Case: Bootstrap cluster, install Tiller, then turn around and capture the bootstrapped resources as charts/resources
Butcher/Scott: Capturing existing resources for already-deployed Kubernetes clusters
Steve: Trimming out state information is painful. Might be nice to have a ‚Äúspec‚Äù that an object can be imported into
Majiec: Two arguments for doing this as a plugin instead:
It can make use of Helm as libraries
It forces improvements of the API
Lachie: Concern is with starting to confuse what the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù is for features.
Taylor: Okay, I do it as a plugin, with the goal of making it a ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù plugin



CircleCI/automation/etc

Majiec: The discussion so far is that we are up to limits of CircleCI. But my own experience is that we have been able to run tests for about :30 in CircleCI. Maybe we still can run a Docker-in-Docker Kubernetes cluster
Adam: I actually reserved you a dedicated e2e resource
Scott: It would be great to be able to kick off building OS packages and have that trigger on releases, as an extension of release management.
Fisher: Maybe you (Scott) and I can chat about that
Lachie: Chart maintainers are also talking about that today
