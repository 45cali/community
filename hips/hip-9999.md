## Abstract

The picking of PRs into a release branch is currently the responsibility of the maintainer
cutting the release.  It is usually the largest part of cutting a release.  Improving
the picking process would make cutting releases easier with a reduced risk of error.

## Motivation

In the current picking process the maintainer that merges a PR is only required to tag that PR with a `needs-pick` 
label. The day of the patch release the maintainer cutting the release will go through each PR
with a `needs-pick` label and manually cherry-pick it into the release branch.  Once the
cherry-pick is done, the `picked` label is added to the PR.

There are multiple issues with this process:
1. Manual work for the maintainer doing the release to pick each relevant PR.
1. Possible merge conflicts during the cherry-picks as the code on master may
have substantially diverged from the code in the release branch.  This is particularly concerning
as the maintainer cutting the release may not be the one who reviewed the PR in question
and may not be familiar with its details, thus making resolving the conflicts difficult
and error prone.
1. There is basically no soak time for the cherry-picks or merge conflict resolution code:
some quick manual testing and the unit tests are the only tests these changes go through. 

## Rationale

By cherry-picking PRs as soon as they are merged into the master branch will allow to
address the issues mentioned above.  It will reduce the manual work required
at release time, will reduce the risk of errors during merge conflicts, and will provide
more time to soak the release branch content.

## Specification

The pick process would be modified to the following:
1. Once a PR is merged into the master branch the `needs-pick` label will still be applied.
This is to reduce the risk of forgetting to cherry-pick a PR.
1. Once the PR is merged into the master branch, it becomes the responsibility of the merging maintainer to
cherry-pick it into the release branch; this should be done through a new PR and be done as
soon as possible.  In the case of contributions, the merging maintainer can optionally ask
the contributor to post a new PR targeting the release branch.
1. The new PR description should reference the original PR and relevant issue(s).
1. As any other PR, the new PR should go through the full review process.
1. Once the new PR is merged into the release branch, the merging maintainer should add the
`picked` label in the original PR.  A comment specifying the new PR number should also be added
to the original PR. 
1. On a regular basis, or at least one week before a patch release date, the list of `needs-pick`
PRs without a `picked` label should be verified in case any was forgotten.

With this process, the release branch should always be in a state that is ready for release;
the maintainer cutting the release does not need to perform any cherry-picking.

For increased quality of patch releases, the release branch can be used by the community
at any time, so as to verify no issues are present by the time the release day comes around.

## How to teach this

Each Helm core maintainer should be told about this new process and asked to read the HIP.

## Reference implementation

A PR will be posted to update the release checklist to match the new process.
