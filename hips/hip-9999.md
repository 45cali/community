## Abstract

Define and document the backwards-compatibility rules that apply to Helm minor and patch releases.

## Motivation

Helm aims to strictly respect [Semantic Versioning][semver], where minor and patch releases must be 100% backwards-compatible.
Backwards-compatibility implies that when moving to a new backwards-compatible release:
* tools (such as Continuous Integration tools) using the helm CLI will not require any changes
* programs using the Helm Go API will continue to compile 

Some contributors to the Helm code base may not be comfortable with the details of what constitutes a compatibility-breaking change.
Furthermore, in some cases, there can be a difference of opinion, even amongst the maintainers, on what constitutes such a change.

Having a well-defined, documented set of backwards-compatibility rules for the Helm code-base will allow to:
* avoid compatibility-breaking changes being merged by mistake
* guide contributors in understanding helm's backwards-compatibility requirements
* remove any uncertainty when it comes to enforcing backwards compatibility
* provide a basis for discussion and possible updates to how helm handles backwards compatibility

## Rationale

The maintainers have agreed that a formal definition of Helm's backwards-compatibility rules would be beneficial.

## Specification

The following compatibility rules will apply to helm minor and patch releases:
* exported Go APIs will remain compatible as per this [article][go-module-comp]
* CLI commands:
    * are case-sensitive
    * must not be removed
    * must not be renamed
    * must not be moved elsewhere in the command hierarchy
* CLI flags:
    * are case-sensitive
    * must not be removed
    * must not be renamed
    * must not be moved in the command hierarchy
    * must not change type
* CLI output must:
    * ???

## Security implications

N/A

## How to teach this

* The list of compatibility rules should be published on helm.sh with a global explanation of the motivation behind to need to follow them
* The list of compatibility rules should be used as a reference by maintainers when doing code reviews
* During PR reviews, when appropriate, the reviewing maintainer should refer the contributor to the list of compatibility rules

## Reference implementation

A reference implementation for this proposal to be accepted will be:
* Posting a PR to helm-www listing the compatibility rules and the motivation behind respecting them

## Open issues

* Should Go's experimental [apidiff][apidiff] tool be used?  The following [issue][apidiff-install] gives a couple of ways to install it.
* Should the rules specifically mention the helm packages that must respect compatibility? (e.g., `pkg` for Go API, `cmd` for CLI)
