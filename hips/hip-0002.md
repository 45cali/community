## Abstract

This HIP provides a sample template for creating your own HIPs. In conjunction
with the guidelines in [HIP 1][1], this should make it easy for you to
write your own HIPs.

## Rationale

If you intend to submit a HIP, it is highly recommended to use this template, in
conjunction with the format guideline, to ensure that your HIP submission won't
be automatically rejected because of form.

Markdown provides HIP authors with useful functionality and expressivity, while
maintaining easy readability in the source text. The processed HTML form makes
the functionality accessible to readers: live hyperlinks, styled text, tables,
images, and automatic tables of contents, among other advantages.

## How to use this template

To use this template you must first decide whether your HIP is going to be an
informational, process, or feature HIP. Most HIPs are of type "feature" because
they propose a new feature for the Helm project or standard library. When in
doubt, read [HIP 1][1] for details.

Once you've decided which type of HIP yours is going to be, make a copy of this
file and perform the following edits:

- Do NOT change the `hip: 9999` header since you don't yet have a HIP number
  assigned. This is to prevent merge conflicts with other HIPs.
- Change the `title` header to the title of your HIP.
- Change the `authors` header to include your name(s), and optionally your email
  address(es). Be sure to follow the format carefully: your name must appear
  first, and it must not be contained in parentheses. Your email address may
  appear second (or it can be omitted) and if it appears, it must appear in
  angle brackets. It is okay to obfuscate your email address.
- Change the `created` header to the current date, following [RFC 3339][rfc3339]
  format.
- For feature HIPs, change the `type` header to "feature".
- For informational HIPs, change the `type` header to "informational".
- For process HIPs, change the `type` header to "process".
- Do NOT change the `status` header from `draft`.
- For feature HIPs, if your feature depends on the acceptance of some other
  currently in-development HIP, add a `requires` header right after the `status`
  header. The value should be the HIP number of the HIP yours depends on. Don't
  add this header if your dependent feature is described in a "final" HIP.
- Add a `replaces` header if your HIP obsoletes an earlier HIP. The value of
  this header is the number of the HIP that your new HIP is replacing. Only add
  this header if the older HIP is in "final" form, i.e. is either accepted,
  final, or rejected. You aren't replacing an older open HIP if you're
  submitting a competing idea.
- Now write your Abstract, Rationale, and other content for your HIP, replacing
  all this gobbledygook with your own text.
- Update your References section.

For reference, all of the possible header fields are available in [HIP 1][1].

## Specification

Various sections are found to be common across HIPs and are outlined in [HIP
1][1]. Those sections are provided here for convenience.
