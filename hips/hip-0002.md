## Abstract

Have well-known cyclical release dates for Helm minor and patch releases.
Have published release dates for Helm major releases, once such a release has entered the implementation phase.

## Motivation

Contributors and users/organizations greatly appreciate knowing in advance when the next release will be available.
It allows contributors to plan their work and organizations to schedule migration plans; it also provides users with clear timelines for access to bug fixes and features.

## Rationale

Minor and patch releases for Helm normally occur a couple of times a year.  They therefore lend themselves well to cyclical, pre-defined release dates.

As it is not recommended to use Helm with a version of Kubernetes that is newer than the version Helm was compiled against ([see here][helm-skew]), there is value in aligning the date for Helm minor releases with [Kubernetes releases][kubernetes-dates], which state that "X.Y.0 occur 3 to 4 months after X.(Y-1).0".

Helm major releases happen rarely and therefore do not lend themselves to pre-defined, cyclical release dates.  However, upon the availability of the first beta version of a major release, a specific final release date should be chosen and announced.

## Specification

Patch releases should be done once a month on the second Wednesday of each month.

For minor releases, it is not necessary to aim for dates that are the same every year.  Instead, the following is proposed:
* Once a Helm minor release is made, the release date of the next minor release must be announced.
* To align with Kubernetes releases, a 4-month minor release cadence should be adopted (so at least 3 minor releases of Helm per year)

Extra minor releases can be added to the schedule when needed.  However:
* An extra minor release should not change a planned minor release date, unless the planned release is less than 7 days away.  This is to avoid postponing the release of features that are still on-going and planned according to the originally stated release date.
* Extra minor releases should only be done for important reasons (as per judgment of the maintainers) to avoid increasing the burden on organizations that choose to upgrade at every release.

## Security implications

Security releases do not follow any planned dates and should be done as soon as required.

## How to teach this

* When a Helm minor release is made, the next minor release number and date should be chosen and announced at the same time.
* The Helm website should have a page mentioning each planned release and its date.  This page should be updated at each release.

## Reference implementation

Should this proposal be accepted, putting it in place would mean:
* Selecting the date of the next minor release
* Documenting the new process and the chosen date on helm.sh under Community with a note in the FAQ section
* Updating the release check-list to include the step of selecting the next minor release date
* Communicating the new process to core-maintainers through the mailing list
* Publishing a blog to inform the community of this new process
* Making a very strong effort to respect the announced dates

## Open issues

* This HIP proposes that for minor releases, only the date of the next release will be announced.  We could instead have fixed dates such as: "The first Wednesday of February, June and October".  What approach is preferred?
* How many previous versions of Helm receive patch releases? If more than one, should those patch releases be on the same date?
