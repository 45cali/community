# Helm Community Proposals

To learn more about the purpose of proposals and how to go about writing a
proposal, please start reading [the first proposal](proposal-0001.md).

## Markdown for Proposals

Original proposal source should be written in Markdown format, and the format is
described in 0001. Older proposals were often written in a more mildly
restricted markdown format and can be found in the
[archives](archives/README.md).
