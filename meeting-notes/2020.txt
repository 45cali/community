Announcements
3.5.0 Milestone · GitHub - 3.5 RC1 will be cut on Monday Jan 4 2021, and 3.5 will be released Wednesday Jan 13 2021.
Half PRs still open
OCI- found issues, Farina will work on it over the break
Whatever gets in this year is what will land
This is the last Helm weekly developer call of 2020; no call on Dec 24 or Dec 31; the Helm weekly developer call will resume on Jan 7 2021.

Discussion
[Joe Julian] I’m off the rest of the year. Can I please get my PR merged before I go since I won’t be around to keep rebasing it before RC1? Reduce linting severity for users of out-of-date kubernetes #8608
Bridget: it’s in the 3.5.0 milestone - when do those get reviewed/merged?
Farina: hopefully reviewed by end of the week
December is a terrible time to get features into Helm
Farina: with mature projects, esp this time of year, takes longer. Slower at merging since reviewing with other maintainers to consider implications
Joe: concerned since using a fork for their linter now
Joe: wondering as first time contributor what should have done differently
Farina: thank you for the feedback
[Shoubhik Bose] Engineering architect for GitOps
Would like to have more disciplined approach to contributing
Best way to understand from list of PRs for where to contribute?
Looking at milestones
[Bridget] yes, looking at milestones is great
[Farina] one of best - look at PRs and walkthrough
Start walking through and test
Give feedback - not just when something is wrong, but when something is good
For people who want to be maintainers - get the title once you’re already doing it
[Bridget] what if we run a new Helm maintainer workshop
Walk through the process
Have more senior maintainers act as mentors
Bridget to work with Butcher and CNCF

Discussion
[Tim St. Clair] - Helm 4, modularity, and pluggable templating.
Tim St Clair: Saw KubeCon NA 2020 talk about past/present/future
Tim St Clair: Is familiar with templating issues
Tim St Clair: Used to be Heptio/RH, and in vmware they’re seeing ytt - but the templating theme keeps repeating itself
Tim St Clair: Interested in an abstraction layer around charts itself
Farina: in Helm 2 we had a mechanism for setting templating engine - “engineyard”
Farina: and nobody ever extended it! Existed, and nobody used it
Tim: in this moment, the demand is now here
Butcher: the right step is probably a HIP - now is a good time
Fisher: possible opportunity of revving to API v3.
Fisher: in a HIP we could discuss backwards compat, use cases, post-rendering
Marc: Tim, would you also be providing implementation?
Tim: I’d be working with a team to do so
Helm v3.5.0 [Farina] - this is less than a month away - the core maintainers should please review over the next two weeks
This is a small release but we do want to get it ready
Helm meeting calendar vs Helm release calendar [Marc]
Fisher: no objection to merging - we also use github milestones to communicate
Farina: calendar is also for us
Introductions
	Mark Fisher, Aaron Hurley, John Ryan - Tanzu team - https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/hips/hip-0001.md 
	Karena Angell - Red Hat 
	Joe Julian - d2IQ - Helm needs for their customers
Storage backend needs: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8977 [Joe Julian]
Joe Julian - label selectors don’t work - either break up by namespaces or query the predictable-name releases by name
Butcher: there is a pluggable system for alternative data stores
John Ryan: how about WASM, Lua, etc?
Butcher: web assembly is an idea on the table

Announcements
 Next patch release (3.4.2) will be Wednesday Dec 9 - add relevant issues/PRs to https://github.com/helm/helm/milestone/106 [Bridget]
[Dan] Few things still need to happen in milestone. 
Review bugs in issue queue for 3.4.2 Tuesday is last day to put in
Interested in being a Helm maintainer, reach out to Farina, shadow on Wednesday release available.

Discussion
Chart Examples in Docs [Bridget]
[Bridget] We now have a request to update docs to refer to something other than deprecated charts (https://github.com/helm/helm-www/issues/965)  
[Bridget] Adam and I previously discussed a helm-org repo with illustrative example charts 
[Bridget] Not intended to be supported as production-ready, but meant to forestall the inevitable changes if we point to a third party
[Bridget] any objection to us creating that repo under the helm org? Currently used repos are called chart-release and chart-testing - perhaps we could call it chart-examples?
[Dan] How do we handle mentioning deprecated charts…
Farina: Take something like ChartMuseum and point to it as example
Farina: Or… Create examples repository and use it as example charts, use providence files etc all best practices. 
[Josh] Should we have examples of more than just charts? 
Farina: Let’s make sure we can use CI to test things, so, keep separate repos
Resolution: yes, let’s have examples showing best practices including chart signing, and not claiming to be production-grade. Bridget, Farina, Garfield to tackle after holidays.
Re: examples, we had a similar discussion here at Hashi about standardizing demos, and it ended up an internal group wrote an app ("HashiCups") just to be the example app for product demos. Probably not necessary to write a whole fake coffee shop storefront like our group did but it might be useful to have something like a "Helm guestbook" that exists just to be an example app for Helm chart examples.

Passing arguments to post-renderer [Marc]
(https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/9047) 
Idea is to split on space:
--post-renderer "kubectl kustomize calico/kustomize"
Backwards-compatibility issue?
--post-renderer "./my binary.exe"
Do we need a flag e.g., --post-renderer-args
[Farina] breaking on a space is potentially unreliable, use environment variables instead
[Marc] 
Fisher: https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/d3d1ceab4f30ef792195f6a2b0fbf36a3b300340/pkg/postrender/exec.go#L45-L67 
[Josh] I vote to have the flag because you can’t always predict the binary you’re using. Use env if you control the binary, but the flag would be useful for the edge case
[Marc] the goal here is to allow usage of “kubectl kustomize” as a post-renderer
Resolution: Marc will review and comment in the PR
 
Moving size labels to GitHub action [Farina]
Currently a service hosted in helm hub cluster
[Farina] Our size labels all come from a deprecated repo. Want to port into Github Actions instead
[Fisher] Github Actions have been very reliable. Very in favor
Conclusion: Farina will start working on moving sizing labels to github actions
[Fisher] LGTM

Translation PRs… when multiple people are committers and the lgtm comes from a committer? [Farina]
[Fisher] We have LGTM’d our own PRs before when pair programming on a fix, but context is everything though… LGTM’ing your own code doesn’t seem to match up with the code review process. Is the committer LGTM’ing another author’s code and they only provided a few edits, or were they the original author?
[Bridget] I review a lot of translation PRs. I compare the final result’s google translate with the English original to get a rough sense of what’s there, and comment if there’s an issue like a section being skipped.
[Bridget] Issues arise in particular if they forked some time ago and are translating an old version of the page.
[Bridget] I would like to recruit more maintainers from the various language groups for them to do this step, but I would want to formalize this final side-by-side check as part of the process.
[Bridget] Can we get some of the people reviewing to be maintainers to actually check. When translations are behind it causes drift. Can we formalize steps. 
Conclusion: Garfield will go do some investigation into what might work best and discuss with Bridget and come back.

[Josh] Congrats to Bridget and Fisher for winning the CNCF chopping wood and carrying water award!

[dlipovetsky] action.List client is unable to return a list of all releases (#9028)
[Fisher] Helm CLI does rely on statemask for filtering releases etc in the action package. Under CMD/helm/lists/go it calls action and returns. I *believe* the statemask is what’s setting the filtering. That might be a place to start looking for bugs. Issues with statemask in the past and design concerns with backwards compatibility.

Following the new HIP process, #?
Farina to take a look and help drive it along
Upcoming call schedule
Will there be a dev weekly call next week (conf week)? [Martin]
[Bridget] Keynotes start on Thursday Nov 19 at 1pm Eastern: https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/schedule/ - Helm call is 12:30-1pm Eastern, so might not conflict badly?
[Bridget] should we cancel the meeting for Nov 26 - US Thanksgiving? And Dec 24 (Christmas Eve), and Dec 31 (NYE)? We could have the last meeting of 2020 on Dec 17, then resume on Jan 7?
[fisher] yes. We usually cancel dev call meetings on US federal holidays as well as the week during/after KubeCon NA when most of the maintainers are present.
[Bridget] No meeting Nov 19, Nov 26; yes meeting Dec 3, Dec 10, Dec 17; no meeting Dec 24, Dec 31; Yes meeting Jan 7 and going forward.
Do we have better/more stats on chart downloads now? [Bridget]
 Nope! Because GitHub Pages
Charts that upgrade with an issue when the previous version used a deprecated API. Ref https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/9014 [Martin]
Something using deployment appbeta (old thing), when you upgrade the chart, the old thing is not deleted due to new API versions
“Documenting is better than magic” (lets document this edge case)
Link to release calendar on helm.sh? [Marc]
Marc will make a PR

Farina: the stable and incubator repos are about to leave artifact hub
Farina: we cut the 3.4.1 release on Wednesday

Discussion
Deprecation(s) Status Check [Bridget]
8 days to go
Do we want a super-minimal blog post that just explains that if you do nothing else, you should do this:
helm repo rm stable
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
Farina: maybe a blog post to pull their stuff out of stable and incubator? Git history?
Joe Julian: remind people to check requirements yaml
Bridget: reach out to Scott Rigby and Matt Farina; draft last-minute tactical “what you must do” blog post.
How do we communicate essential info about changes with people we’re missing via our usual channels? [Farina]
Bridget] AKS emailed customers; GKE can’t do that but will do outreach
[Farina] Do we have any Digital Ocean contacts?
Farina: Minikube builds in a pop-up
Marc: in a deprecation you can mention it in the tool itself
Paul C: corporate users aren’t big fans of MOTD from internet
Bridget: get their service providers to reach out, when possible?
Martin: get people the message when they upgrade their tool
Marc: perhaps optionally enable “helm announcement”?
Farina: will consider and start a HIP
From Paul Czarkowski to Everyone: (11:43 AM)
a bit left field I just thought of we could have an announcements field in the index.yml of chart repos, and any time a person does a `helm repo update` they'd get a printout of the announcements.
From Paul Czarkowski to Everyone: (11:44 AM)
then we could have an announcements repo that has an index.yaml but no charts so people can subscribe to announcements by adding the repo



Release histories not pruned. Since they are failures… should they be? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8881 [Farina]
Farina: pruning only happens after a good installation - could end up with many failed
Joe Julian: happens thousands of times in CI/CD
Martin: technically a bug - but the logic from the last deployed release is valid
Marc: let’s continue the discussion in the PR

Lint all docs in Multi-doc yaml, should we include a new parser `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/yaml` ? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8862 [Martin]
Should https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8913 be merged to fix https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8621 and new issue opened to cover other issues raised?
Farina: two cases: if you have an empty template, or multiple docs in the yaml file - maybe there is an existing issue for the “multiple” case?
Farina: we should merge both
Joe Julian: I think the one you're thinking of talked about multiple empty documents in the file:
---
---
---
 
Are internal commands subject to backwards-compatibility (helm docs) [Marc]
Farina: Let’s put it behind a flag

What’s the best source of replacement examples for the docs? (assuming we may not want to point at stable anymore) [Bridget]
Farina: sounds good - could document best practices

Bridget: who’s got questions or concerns around the changes?
Joe Julian: we’ve been telling customers they have to upgrade
Martin: you don’t have to change the version of Helm - but do have to point to the right places
Marc: at a minimum, 2.17 would be important because of Tiller.
Farina: we don’t have a solid date on when the GCR buckets will stop working
Joe Thompson: question about the deprecation - what’s the emergency procedure in place?
Farina: the current plan is every chart will point to an archive that gives an error
Dan Garfield: should we yank it early?
Bridget: let’s not make breaking changes during shopping holiday change freeze
Martin: and remember, the archived charts will still exist.
Paul: let’s not disrupt people for no reason
Farina: charts.helm.sh is going nowhere. The google location is what we don’t control.
Martin: so, change your URLs to charts.helm.sh!

 3.4 & 2.17 [Farina]
upgrade!

Discussion
Deprecation(s) Update [Farina]
Farina: Friday November 13th, Helm v2 support ends and charts stable/incubator go into archive mode
Farina: Blog post going out tomorrow
Farina: CNCF will post things Friday and Monday - also, Kube Weekly
Farina: Removing stable and incubator from artifact hub on Nov 6th
[Scott] discoverability will increase as charts get relocated to new repos
Farina: helm/helm CI won’t break with the Docker changes
Helm Hub -> Artifact Hub move [Farina]
Can we get this PR looked at for the 3.5 milestone or before? Replace Helm Hub with Artifact Hub · Issue #8626 · helm/helm [Bridget]
Farina: it pays to add your items early!
Farina: we as a whole get the traffic to hub.helm.sh and are redirecting it to artifact hub - other choices include passing DNS to artifact hub in terms of them doing the redirect
Bridget: does this affect stats?
Farina: we can get that now (though it’s not super useful data - unsure what some of these queries are)
Scott: of course we want to decrease our maintenance burden but we might want data
Butcher: we shouldn’t be in the critical path - let’s instead help Artifact Hub craft good stats/reporting
Farina: reach out to artifact hub maintainers for stats/data
Farina: let’s redirect to artifact hub (affirmed by the call)

Dependabot k8s patch updates and Helm patch releases [Farina]
Check on packages that have bugfixes, if we consume them
Fisher: sometimes these affect helm - a recent client release did
Adam: let’s look at them and (usually) merge

Focus on recruiting new maintainers [Butcher]
Butcher: let’s form a sub-team to strategize about solving this
Bridget: volunteers
Adam: people may not want new commitments this time of year
Fisher: we could start doing up-front work on docs and testing
Karena Angell [Red Hat] would like to be more involved - wants clarity on what the Helm community _needs_. (Pradeepto B, in chat, is also on her team.)
Butcher: as a group we need to identify who would make good core maintainers
Butcher: we can mention it on calls
Farina: have we documented being a maintainer?
Adam: yes - it’s documented (https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/helm-maintainers-onboarding-guide.md) 
Bridget & Farina will follow up with docs


Generating docs for helm-www (not done for 3.4?) [Marc]
https://helm.sh/docs/helm/
v2? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8869 
[Bridget] this is a manual process - https://github.com/helm/helm-www#updating-the-helm-cli-reference-docs 
Bridget and Marc will sync

update chart repository dependency references https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/23971 [Marc]
Farina and Scott will pair on this

[joe] Can I get this merged? Reduce linting severity for users of out-of-date kubernetes · Issue #8608 · helm/helm 
Deprecated APIs were the reason originally - upstream has now started keeping this data, and this is useful
Fisher: this has one LGTM - Adam will look at it
Farina: added to the 3.5 milestone

Helm v3.4 and v2.17 [Farina]
RC1s out
Plan is to release on Monday & blog post Monday as well
Main release features:
Default location for Tiller is GHCR (not to be confused with GCR!)
New helm repo location
Criteria to accept dependabot PR [Marc]
Cobra 1.1.1 https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8916
What is the criteria for sub-dependencies brought in by dependabot? [Marc]
Is test passing sufficient? Fisher thinks for the most part it is good to merge
There can be exceptions like k8s from time to time [Fisher]
Need to check if licenses are acceptable [Farina]
HIP 0002: Announced release dates [Marc]
Ok to announce 3.5 for January 13th, 2021 once 3.4 released?
Ok to start monthly cycle for patch releases once v2 is done?
https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/869
Once 3.4 is released, then we would like to start announcing major releases. Also patch release announcements. Is this ok to go? [Marc]
Added those milestones and added dates to them [Farina]
We should add a calendar to add the dates in place. Marc is going to add the calendar to the HIP.
Helm Charts Repo Switchover timeline [Vic]
Move charts storage over to GH Pages
Implement URL switchover in Helm 2.17
Move index.yaml in GCS to point to new GH pages URLs
Create specially crafted chart that presents users with a hard failure 
Mark all charts as deprecated
Switch index.yaml to point all charts to the specially crafted chart
Reduce the size of the index.yaml
Disable public access to buckets
Chart producers: Repos switching but need to move charts to new host [Farina]
Chart consumers: Switching stable/incubator but repo is going to become an archive [Farina]
Ongoing plan: Martin points out that some still haven’t changed - who then are (by default) archived
“Band aid” needs to be ripped off wrt obsolescence of charts. So charts are messaged that the charts are deprecated. [Farina]
Message so that users know that charts are deprecated [Dan]
Lint warning when no `templates` directory. Should this be removed as you don’t need it for a valid chart Ref: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8033 [Martin]

Helm turns 5. Started Oct 19, 2015 (first committed). [Farina]
Butcher points out it’s like 80 in internet years
Discussion
Stable and Incubator repos [Farina]
Should we consider extending the date to make helm/charts read-only, since it has taken longer than expected to relocate stable charts [Scott]
Scott: personally I'm of two minds about this. On one hand extending this could help keep end users happy while the charts relocation effort is continued / escalated. OTOH, it may make chart maintainers feel why bother to help relocate. I would say if we consider this, it would be capped to specific number of months
Paul: read only timeline is still good IMO
Much discussion on TOC list etc
Farina: lesson learned: don’t use a bucket name - use custom domains/CDNs for flexibility
Farina: Kubernetes credits for GCP only apply to k8s itself, not other CNCF projects, so it’s a funding issue to keep these from
Butcher: GitHub has raised bandwidth caps to allow for chart repos - we will make public announcement/thanks next week
Scott: about 45min to pull down the index file - in-flight
Farina: should we update the URL in people’s configs?
Vic: ideas on what we can do - we can’t change the response offered by cloud storage. But a better experience would be ideal (like changing index file, or possibly better: changing the index to point to a chart that has a require field that won’t in their files, but points them at docs to help them fix this.)
Martin: option 2 good, because otherwise people will never update
Vic: this is a happy medium - but my main concern is not wanting to blow away their resources.
Fisher: are there any stable or incubator charts signed by chart authors, which might lead to a failure?
Farina: no, nothing is signed.
Fisher: Can we swap out what they receive without telling them?
Bridget: If we’d had a custom domain in the first place they’d never know when we swap out back-ends, unless it breaks 
Vic: a hard fail is safest and a message telling them the path forward
Farina: we need some kind of direction in 2.17 that tells people what to do.
Butcher: what was the argument against automatic, other than proxies?
Joe Julian: many customers are behind proxies with air-gapped clusters
Farina: proxies sometimes limit domains/routing - we should print a message in logs
Farina: we will add something to 2.17 and 3.4 for this. Also: how do we handle stable/incubator?
1 - do nothing/404
2 - redirect to new download locations (will err eventually)
3 - we could craft a required with a variable that does not exist to throw an exception - but needs investigation/testing
Timeline: we need a solution before Nov 13 
2 weeks before, we could have all charts fail or could give a message
Fisher: client caches locally so without helm repo update, we won’t have them getting updates to their local
Let’s bring this to chat/cartographers list
Farina will look into whether this kind of chart action breaks a cluster.
Vic looking into how much the bill is the index file vs something else
Farina: there is metadata not used - could save bandwidth there
Butcher: on the hook to start the PR for changes to helm 2 and 3 to deal with the stable and incubator repos - docs page for www

Deferred to next week:
Helm v3.4 and v2.17 [Farina]

Helm Lightning Talk @ KubeCon [Karen]
Deadline to fill out the form is Oct 11 
15 minute format
Does anyone have ideas? Highlight something special?
Bridget: Karen talks w/ each maintainer about something specific
Will be pre-recorded
Helm Workshop: v2 to v3 - Oct 21 [Karen]
112 attendees registered to participate, as of this morning!
please sign up on Google sheets so we know you'll be there to help!
We need to register too (it’s free and easy with your existing LF account): https://events.linuxfoundation.org/helm-v3-workshop/ 
Still need “runners” - 
Can expand to non-maintainers if needed
Swag will be involved


Helm Project Pavilion/Office Hours [Karen]Three 45-min office hours 
Last kubecon, was not effective. Numbers disappointing, 3 clickthroughs according to stats
Instead of this we could do office hours (3 45min sessions)
Martin: it worked in San Diego (in person)
3.4 release planning [Farina]
3.5 planned for january
Kube 1.19 support not in a release yet
3.4 Milestone: https://github.com/helm/helm/milestone/94 
7 open items
“Test” -scott 😂
Farina: Let’s set a date: next wednesday: 10/14/2020
Martin: update modules in 2.x?
Should the 3.4 release include https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8626 (Artifact Hub update) [Scott]
No hub search in 2.x 👍 Updated note above
Farina: let’s cut 2.17.0 before 3.4 so the most current is a 3.x
Jobs and --wait flag [Farina]
https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/884#discussion_r501849243
If a job is part of a hook, it waits. But if part of a chart - relies on --wait flag
People have diff views on what wait means
Special case for jobs?

[feature] add option to force/override "Release.Service" back to "Tiller" [Bridget] https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7211 - possible blocker for migration from v2 to v3 - thoughts?
Farina: could probably add a flag?
Adam: should this be built into Helm, though?
Farina: tear down/standup replacement is the only fix for this, because of match label immutability (specifically, the user template added a changing field into a match label)
Scott: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7173#issuecomment-562648387 addresses some of this. Specifically linking to https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7082

https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.3.4
Patch releases; thanks to Farina and Fisher.
Fisher: It might be important to note that 3.3.2 was the initial release with the security fixes, and 3.3.3/3.3.4 were regression fixes

Stable and incubator repositories being removed in November. What is the plan for users? [Martin]
Martin: we had been assuming that in orgs people create their own or fork, but they seem to be using the community repos quite a lot - is the best way to do this a detailed document on how to migrate?
Farina: we probably have to spend October on a major campaign of informing people on how to migrate - it’s not cost-feasible to run them centrally
Martin: the message has gone out but we need a good migration path for people.
Fisher: Karen is the community manager around comms
Farina: Helm 2.17 will have a flag to disable adding the stable and incubator so `helm init` won’t automatically err out, and get tiller image from the github container repository
Adam: what about releases?
Farina: get.helm.sh is in azure but if someone is using the old location then yes that will fail
Fisher: we have a clean migration path and blog post for that (over the last year and a half)
Farina: the 8-meg helm init index.yaml for helm 2 is a big part of the bandwidth
Scott: happy to help with migration path for charts
Farina: will work with Scott on that
Marc: where to continue discussion?
Farina: let’s continue discussion in the charts repo in an issue
Deferred from last week: HIP 002 -- Fixed release dates: https://github.com/helm/community/pull/143 [Marc]
Marc: Getting close to an agreement - we need to agree on a date and publish it
Farina: may be related to k8s 1.20 then? Or something off 1.19?
Butcher: we should cut a 3.3.4 with 1.19 support
Farina: let’s start with the approval of a HIP - we need to look at date possibilities in the coming weeks
Fisher: project and org maintainers can approve these HIPs - final approval details pending
Security patches can lead to unexpected problems. How can we mitigate these with previewing upcoming changes? [Bridget] https://github.com/helm/community/issues/128 
Farina will follow up with the CNCF to get the list set up
Farina: We will need to handle the vetting process for list members - k8s uses a vouching system
Dan: can we use the k8s list?
Farina: the CNCF requires specifics around being a certified distro - Helm repos will have different criteria so this can’t be a subset of the k8s list
Butcher: let’s exercise caution and due diligence here
Martin: we will revisit over coming months
End User Story for KubeCon Keynote Project Highlight [Karen]

Helm v2-to-v3 Hands-on Workshop - Oct 21 [Karen]
Need to decide on content + confirm who can help
Working with CNCF - this will be an official CNCF event
Format: two presentations and hands-on workshop - perhaps 9-1:30 (pacific time) - Karen looking to find out who can help with the workshop portion - going to use the zoom webinar platform, so we would like maintainers to be hands-on
If free, attendees might flake out?
Scott: “Maybe also a git repo for the workshop? Would we want a step-by-step like that? It seems to be a useful pattern for a lot of hands-on workshops”

Contacted the end users to ask them for feedback on Helm [Farina]
Radar was put out by “end users” so Farina reached out to that mailing list for feedback
QCon Plus Helm Session https://plus.qconferences.com/ [Bridget]
Voluntold Butcher & Farina
Discussed stable repo GCP hosting costs with Vic [Scott]
Costs are not small - chart version package history will need a different solution as this is not going to be sustainable after Nov 13
Perhaps we could revisit moving their past packages/index file to github hosting? 
Butcher likes this idea & will help investigate
Talked with ASF about the possibility of hosting charts that install Apache projects [Scott]
They don't currently have a policy that allows this. Here is a proposal based on those conversations to update their policies on "convenience packages" like Helm (it references Helm as well as other packages): https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/Updates+of+policies+for+the+convenience+packages Please comment if you're interested
Licensing/ownership considerations


Discussion Suggest five-minute discussions with a sentence or two about what you’d like to discuss, a link to the issue(s), and your name. Discussion suggestions may be moved to future weeks or GitHub, if warranted.)
Conversation about Helm’s governance [Butcher]
Butcher: two issues. 1) the official org governance structure allocates org maintainership based on which project you’re affiliated with - we need to revise this as projects are sunsetted 2) we also don’t have a project for managing the security team and we should probably add other core maintainers as the project grows - we have no documented process for that either.
Scott and Farina and Martin volunteering to help; also Dan Garfield is willing to help (he’s working on this with the Argo team right now)
Fisher doesn’t think we need to address finance or security org-wide but need to reach out to sub-projects as needed, to provide opportunities for other parties to join in security review
helm/helm call for vote open on 2 approvals for community PRs [Farina]
Farina: we’ve had some commits merged that warranted further discussion - it would be better to catch some issues earlier on
Fisher: we changed this for Helm’s velocity - stability is more important now
Martin: it’s a sticky wicket when you get into backwards-compat
Changing vs extending error strings [Marc] - is this okay?
Fisher: if the error message is output being parsed, then changing it could break scripts - so additive is different from changing/removing - also, changing error types can cause problems for other packages that import, etc (depends on context)
Butcher: perhaps this needs more discussion (as go the language will routinely change error text)
Process HIP could be the path forward! Marc will star;t will need input from other maintainers
Decision on whether the merged PR fixing the few remaining stdout to c.Log is considered a PATCH or MAJOR (whether it should be rolled back until Helm 4, or ok to stay) [Scott] https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8437
This one seemed really on the edge for the team, as format was changed (grep should still work), but it is a difference. In keybase nearly everyone seemed to go either way on this one
Fisher: we can work on this in parallel
Docs translations quirk [Bridget]
An ever-growing number of PRs (https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Atranslation) for translations of https://helm.sh/docs/helm/ are waiting for merge because the English pages are auto-generated by the cli and then stored on the website, which cannot currently be done for other languages - is it okay to put translations of some of these docs on the website, with the understanding that (for the foreseeable future) they won’t be generated by or visible in the cli?

Helm v2 deprecation tasks [Bridget]
Default tiller image location
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7211 (heritage=Tiller issue)
Farina: GitHub container registry will be the default, with mirrors on quay and dockerhub
Blog post and announcement with CNCF [Dan Garfield]
Dan: Started drafting blog post to clarify what will help people who find that their tiller location is gone
Bridget: https://helm.sh/blog/helm-v2-deprecation-timeline/
Marc: we need to clarify what the user experience change is
Scott: From Keybase, Paul & I have volunteered to work on a post for updating from stable to elsewhere (mostly a how-to for chart maintainers. But also can be helpful for end users
Martin: we have to talk about this again next week
Scott: Here’s the issue to follow: https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/21103💯

Discussion (Suggest five-minute discussions with a sentence or two about what you’d like to discuss, a link to the issue(s), and your name. Discussion suggestions may be moved to future weeks or GitHub, if warranted.)
De-listing stable and incubator from Helm Hub as planned? (followup from last week) [Farina]
Two current thoughts on migration plan for users:
1) chartcenter is hosting a “mirror” of the stable and incubator repositories
2) storing this ourselves in S3
Josh: does this mean new URLs?
Farina: yes. We cannot move google cloud storage buckets from one to another, preventing us from migrating the URL in a clean fashion
Fisher: has there been a discussion over with the chart maintainers on which path seems worth investigating?
Farina: this is something we need to talk more about there
Marc: the one thing that’s a bummer about all this is the guarantee that there is a “stable” repository I can depend on
Farina: the hard discussion here has to do with billing. Google has been sponsoring the bucket hosting the charts. Google is now no longer willing to pay for the bucket. If there is a partner willing to pay for a chart repository then we’d be happy to work with them on that
HIP for fixed release dates - https://github.com/helm/community/pull/143 [Marc]
I tried to put the basic ideas in a HIP - 
Butcher: the two things I wanted to ask were: 1) do we always want to discuss security fixes are always as patch releases, and 2) do we want to commit to a new minor release after a Kubernetes release (1 month after or some time after)
Farina: one of the risks was that updating client-go has been a major paint point. Some releases have certainly taken a month to update
Fisher and farina: FWIW, we’ve received backlash for releasing security fixes in a minor release only, so it might be worth making it a point to always cut patch releases in the case of a security fix
Helm security audit [butcher]
We are in the last phases of our security audit. As a reminder, each year the CNCF sponsors a security audit
There will be two reports: an architectural report, and a code report
Two questions: do we want to disclose it to the security maintainers before releasing to the public?
Farina: first opinion, we should release it to the other security maintainers to reduce that bus factor
Fisher: who is on the security maintainers list?
Farina: myself, butcher, fisher, adnan, nikhil, and vic
Storing Tiller after GCR [farina]
Tiller is now in Quay. We’re looking to move to Github Container Registry
(farina had to leave at this point)
Dan Garfield: We should release a coordinated message on the CNCF newsletter, publish on the release notes, make it clear in `helm init --upgrade`, etc. This way we won’t have users upset when their tiller instances restart and it goes into CrashLoopBackoff
Question about governance of Helm and deprecating chart repo [Butcher]
Punted to next week to discuss governance

De-listing stable and incubator from Helm Hub as planned? [Scott & Farina] Progress of finding new homes for stable charts: https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/21103
Stated on 20 Aug that further discussion was needed
Aug 27: stable/incubator becoming unavailable? Blog? [Marc]
Aug 27: Blog post (Farina + Bridget), docs updates, artifact hub switch
Aug 27: Revisit next week
Sept 3: Bridget can participate in blog post writing and docs updating starting Sept 14 
Farina: Many charts have not found new homes - do we want to remove it now? We’re running out of time here
Martin: there were questions around the prometheus chart - large community - Scott working on moving that - we need a clear path forward
Farina: reminder: Nov 13th the bucket will (likely) be garbage-collected - we have an issue on the community repo around moving that elsewhere
Farina: maybe something useful would be a tool to grab the history for a chart and download it etc
Marc: what do we do if important charts aren’t relocated yet?
Farina: we need to make a good plan to move these - I can start work on this Tuesday - JFrog has volunteered on some of these (chart center has a cache)
Martin: charts are where the value of Helm is seen - we need to make sure people have options
Farina: valuable to talk about a new way to replace the stable/incubator repos - I see the problem but the community needs to come up with the answer
Fisher: it’s not like the source code is going away either - there are alternatives but we have to figure out how to support going forward - have we reached out? A question for the chart maintainers team.
Bridget: so we’re moving away from centralized ownership
Farina: Scott is working on a checklist to move to new owners 
Farina: will send out an email to the chart maintainer mailing list after this
Farina: let’s talk about this again next week.

What remains to be done before we can make HIP official? At least a dozen stale issues could easily be resolved with a suggestion to follow the newly-formalized HIP process, once it’s merged. [Bridget] https://github.com/helm/community/pull/140 
Deferred from Aug 27
Fisher: proposal itself is ready - at this point, we need quorum from org maintainers. (PR review and approval)
Fisher: Let’s seek consensus and ensure it’s not too heavy-handed
Farina: Fisher, can you send an email to cartographers?
Fisher: yes

Dependabot: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8574 [Marc]
Deferred from Aug 27
Marc: I think Fisher wanted feedback?
Fisher: I’ve seen cases where dependabot creates PRs for security issues and thus makes it public - sending an email can be safer
Fisher: in a couple cases I’ve seen lots of visibility around npm vulns.
Farina: Docker packages where we don’t use the runtime part have CVEs that don’t impact us - but we would see said CVEs
Bridget: it doesn’t nag - just tells you on each version
Farina: if it’s a problem we can turn it off
Fisher: I’m fine with a trial run - it doesn’t rewrite code, just submits PRs
Fisher: let’s give it a try and we can discuss further if it proves necessary

Application version as container tag? [Farina] https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8562 
Farina: version vs packaging are not the same
Farina: an annotation might be for the application version, not the container tag version - this PR may be a problem vis a vis separation of concerns?
Farina: we may need to communicate more clearly on these matters
Marc: so an empty version is better?
Farina: no, it’s better to have no annotation at all
Bridget: point of order - will we need to revert that PR?
Martin: I volunteer to do it as I merged it in first place - reverting it back may be the best action.

Moving images from DockerHub to GitHub? [Bridget] https://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry
Bridget: should we move to this?
Farina: do we have access to this beta feature?
Fisher: in my tests we have access - it is available to everyone who has packages (as long as you have a token, if you have read access to the API, and you can see /organization)
Farina: I’ll test if we can migrate everything 
Fisher: we should make sure we loop the CNCF in
Bridget: currently no limits on public
Farina: we’d want to avoid hitting a limit but no limit is documented yet

Allow templating in value files? Yes or no? [Martin] https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6876
Martin: this is a huge PR, now broken into three - the big question is what is our opinion on this? Do we want to allow this or tell the person now?
Fisher: there is an issue of cyclic dependencies here - where does Helm’s role end? Templating in a values.yaml file means you need to render before passing into chart, then re-rendering again, and where does it stop? Perhaps that’s a better case for an external tool to do, and have Helm do rendering once?
Farina: there’s separation of concerns here, and I wondered how that PR fit into workflows - this is a great thing for a HIP - the why, the how, how it fits in, dealing with concerns. Little pieces that fit together.
Farina: let’s pause on this until we can suggest they create a HIP
Fisher: I will take the action to explain this pause/conversation to them

Should the “mapkubeapis” plugin be moved to Helm org (https://github.com/hickeyma/helm-mapkubeapis) ? [Martin] 
(deferred from 20 Aug, to when Martin is here)
Martin: We couldn’t find a nice solution, so we still need the plugin - should that be in the Helm org as it’s necessary (instead of in Martin’s github?)
Butcher: related - helmfile has also asked - we need documented guidelines
Farina: helmfile is not apache2 licensed - that’s the big blocker
Butcher: if anyone can document the basics in a helm community PR, that would be a good start
Farina: Martin’s is apache2 so that’s not an issue
Butcher: we could use Martin’s as a test run for the process
Farina: who would like to write this up? I’ll take the followup action
Slack app integration? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8610 [Farina]
(skipped on 20 Aug)
Farina: we can deal with it on GitHub
Bump to Kubernetes v1.18 in Helm v2 [Martin]
This has repercussions for projects that use both Helm v2 and v3 APIs as some k8s API calls would be broken through the Helm v2 API when using latest Helm v3 as a dependency
This would mean not being able to upgrade above Helm 3.1.x
Example: https://github.com/hickeyma/helm-mapkubeapis
Martin: in 3.2 we bumped Helm 3 to 1.18 - some APIs changed
Martin: however, Helm v2 doesn’t require 1.18 - so there will be issues (v2 was on 1.16) - is this something we should do? I can take the action to do it.
Farina: we have 2.17 that needs to come out that takes us off Google for storage, so something else could in theory go in there? 
Bridget: how do we know this doesn’t come with regressions?
Butcher: we need to decide if we’re changing our minds on adding k8s compat that isn’t security, and decide
Dan Garfield: do we have stats on how many people are still pulling those images?
Farina: I can try to pull that as we discuss other things
Highest item: v2.14.3 - the most widely-downloaded - some CI system
Then. 3.x
Three diff 2.x are still in the top ten

De-listing stable and incubator from Helm Hub as planned? [Scott] Progress of finding new homes for stable charts: https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/21103
Stated on 20 Aug that further discussion was needed
stable/incubator becoming unavailable? Blog? [Marc]
Blog post (Farina + Bridget), docs updates, artifact hub switch
Revisit next week

Open question about Helm Hub -> Artifact Hub move: should we keep hub.helm.sh as the default endpoint even after pointing that to artifacthub.io? [scott]
upside: helm org retains control should we need to point elsewhere in future (though we can also always just update the client in backwards-compatible way as in this PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8626
downside: users will be redirected to an eventual different domain than they see in `helm search hub` output
Farina: when we move forward we will have a redirect, but should we change the helm code? 
Bridget: I don’t see a downside
Butcher: let’s set a time to do the domain name switch and do a release that follows the redirects, then migrate at a time that we could message enough so nobody could be surprised
Bridget: let’s keep control of the URL
Martin: agreed
Butcher: so we wouldn’t change the domain name at least until it goes from sandbox to incubation
Farina: we can do something in the messaging to make that more clear
Butcher: staying on same domain for now - someone can propose a transition plan for when artifact hub hits incubation

Taking over a contribution inactive since July 7th 2020? [Marc] https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8111        
Farina: I would ask on the PR about taking it over, then specify an amount of time to take it over - then do a new PR with commits pulled over and close old one and point to new one.
Marc: needs a rebase
                         
3.3.1 release date? Cert-manager users are apparently affected by an issue which 3.3.1 would resolve for them. [Bridget] https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8594#issuecomment-674754119

HH will be redirected to AH when things are stable. Then HH will be removed. And we will do a blog post announcing the change
AH already has migration automated, things are moving quickly.

- Helm GitHub Actions have all released v1.0.0 [Scott]
kind action ( start up a cluster that lives for the further tests such as `helm install` `helm test`
Chart-testing -  lint + install on just the changed charts ( monorepo )
Doesn’t test upgrade by default, but functionality is in the testing tool.
Chart-releaser - creates chart package, adds binary to github release, updates index.yml in to gh-pages.
Scott is driving the rehome of prometheus charts, and is showing off how great the actions are.

Next version - we already have 10 closed items (and no open items) in the milestone for 3.3.1 (https://github.com/helm/helm/milestone/97?closed=1) - what date are we aiming at releasing it? [ Bridget]
End of August after Farina and Butcher are back from vacation
Road-testing 3.3.0 may give us more 
End aug, start Sept May allow us to make choice between 3.3.1 and 3.4.0 (kubecon might surface bugs or features needed for release)
Marc suggests we should do fixed dates for feature releases.
Quarterly minor cadence? [Martin] - move this discussion to next week
Security Mitigation spec/file proposal https://github.com/helm/community/pull/139 [Rimas]
Also see this discussion thread https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0NH30761/p1596744481096000
Rimas shares reference example on screen (see recording)
chartcenter UI lists CVEs that affect a chart
If mitigation file exists, will display notes/comments/etc from that file per CVE
[Fisher] what’s the rationale, how do others use it?  Value prop is there. Do we make this an openstandard, need helm community agreement.

Proposed change to the Helm community proposals: https://github.com/helm/community/pull/140 [fisher]
Fisher talks to need for a proposal on how to create proposals, inspired by Rimas security Mitigation proposal.
Inspired by PEP, KEP, DEP … but lightened up.
[martin] sounds great, but we’re out of time for further discussion this call.

(out of time for this week)
Should the “mapkubeapis” plugin be moved to Helm org (https://github.com/hickeyma/helm-mapkubeapis) ? [Martin]
Stale issue bot: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8521 [fisher]
It is August 13th. We’re now entering the “security fix only” stage of Helm 2 support. Should we close out issues, support questions and bug reports related to Helm 2 at this time? [fisher]

How best to implement `untar` capability for `dependency update` https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8499 [Martin]
When you do an update, you can --untar it.
The capability is in the CLI instead of in the library. Would like input from other maintainers because it seems to modify the download manager, which breaks compatibility. So it might not be viable for Helm 3
Adam will review. Adam listed a few issues that could come up with local v. remote dependencies

Quick update on Security audit
Butcher: one team audits architecture, while another goes through the go code and runs a number of security scanners
Butcher: Trail of Bits found a long-standing bug in macOS (undetected for 10 years!) while doing this audit for Helm. CNCF agreed to have them improve docs too. They are going to make security recommendations for Helm 4.

Timing for next 2.16.x release? [Bridget]
Fisher: perhaps we should wait until August 13
Farina: Do we want a 2.17.0? Farina points out we need to garbage-collect old docker location
Fisher: so we’ll have two releases then
Farina: 2.17.0 likely to go the week of Aug 13
Please add your thoughts today for Marc and Bridget’s KubeCon EU “Intro to Helm”, to be used in a “pop-up video” style! (Must finish editing and upload tomorrow, July 31) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qZ1Srjfio7umKe1DbOt8iRgIQoRELQZq0yLdBTL99BM/edit?usp=sharing [Bridget]

PR https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8529 [Martin]
Does this break backward compatibility?
[fisher] in general, new output that does not break existing use cases should be fine (like adding new columns to `helm list`)
The trick here is that `helm status` is plain text - no formatting applied here
[farina] there are a few bugs in `helm status` right now which can change the output, so this output can change
I would ping Matt Butcher on this particular topic - he may have more historical context on whether this may be a breaking change
[fisher] what output from helm status, if breaking, is to be considered here?
Two weeks to go! V2 end-of-support progress: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8343 [Bridget]

 OCI Support Updates [Josh]
Proposal doc: https://github.com/jdolitsky/community/blob/oci-support-updates/proposals/oci-support-updates.md
Community repo PR: https://github.com/helm/community/pull/136
Summary:
Implement `Getter` and introduce `Pusher`
Support for provenance files
Chart versions == OCI reference tags
Chart names == OCI reference basenames
`helm chart` is removed, integrated into rest of CLI
Experimental until clear messaging from OCI
The goal was to get the base case to be in line with the chart repository API. It doesn't preclude expanding to address other use cases
Cache may also be removed, since the tech debt cost may outweigh the benefits
Jacob: Q: do we plan to support digest references? We need this use case
A: let's address that in the proposal. If not a breaking change, we could introduce post-stable
Github’s /releases/latest API - we’re now up to 10 issues closed on the same subject. Should we consider using github’s “pin issue” feature for these threads? [fisher]
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8502
Could we solve the problem by retagging the 3.x release? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22822586/swap-latest-release-on-github [Marc]
A concern with re-creating tags is breaking other systems like homebrew etc
Also, it would be mis-leading to users to advertise a different date than the actual release date
Jacob LeGrone: have we looked at server-side apply? https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/04/01/kubernetes-1.18-feature-server-side-apply-beta-2/

When shall we finalize the 3.3.0 release? How about 2.16.10 and/or 2.17.0? [Bridget] 
Farina: Possible issue with the release candidate - we need to chase this down: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8467
Farina: We do need to add some features for 2.x - skip repos, provide tiller from elsewhere - those need to be completed for 2.17
Farina: tiller available on dockerhub now
Farina: 2.16.x could go out at any time
Support non conformant Kubernetes objects [Martin]:
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8439
Martin thinks there are interrelated issues - asks Ashok (community member) to introduce topic
Ashok clarifies the benefits of adding weighting/ordering
Adam asks if this is for just custom resources
Ashok clarifies that it’s for all resources
Farina points out the issues with sort order when you get outside built-in resources - people want to order things differently than the default - requires consideration of dependencies
Adam points out we don’t separate dependent chart objects from parent chart objects
Farina’s proposed solution: top-level chart could specify order (with an advanced feature toggled on)
Adam: if ordering is dependent, how do upgrades work?
Farina: use the sort ordering in the chart
Adam: need to consider how to deal with dependent objects if parents get upgraded
Farina: solved with config maps - could expand to dependencies - put metadata in Chart.yaml
[long discussion]
Concept from Paul:
My idea for a KindOrder resource wouldn't require a CRD tho ...  just telling helm that the resource is for it ... not the kube cluster ...  helm would render and consume anything with helm.sh/*, but not apply to the cluster
Why would we expose that in a CRD like object? Why not just as metadata in the _Chart.yaml_ file? [Farina]
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8441
Discussion will continue in https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8448 
 Recreate upgrade strategy [Martin]:
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7431
delete/recreate is a sufficient solution (Butcher in https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7431#issuecomment-658440433)
Should it and any other similar issues/PRs be closed?

Ongoing triage of v2 issues and v2 PRs
This doc’s ownership [Farina]
Bridget just had Michelle move it to Butcher - done
Resolver vs manager internal cache vs making user manually add repos for deps? [Farina] https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8449 
Farina: Possible fixes: internal cache, error out
Adam: related was a backwards-compat issue
Farina: whatever we do it will break some CI toolchains
Followup: look at the issue and see what you can add - we want to fix this but be as non-invasive as possible.
[moving to next week] OCI Update after maintainer chat early this week [Josh]
We should implement a new interface GetterPusher - similar to Getter but with upload capabilities (also implements Getter). This will allow using oci:// everywhere where chart repos are referenced
Provenance files will be supported. They will be stored on the manifest as a second layer. If using “helm pull --verify”, 2nd layer will be assumed to be the prov file, and validated
Registry reference tags will be 1-to-1 with chart version (for now). Later on, we may support arbitrary tags, but not until this is more stable
Registry reference basenames will be 1-to-1 with chart name
Most “helm chart” commands should be removed where possible. For example “helm chart save” -> “helm package --save-oci”
As a criteria for removing experimental flag: all of above should be implemented, distribution-spec should release v1.0, and there should be clear language on OCI side supporting Helm’s use of “artifacts” / media-types

Does https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6710 need a v3 tag? (We may or may not fix it for v2, but it lacks a v3 tag and people claim it affects v3.)  
When do we want to release 2.16.10? Can we get a second review on https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7360 to unblock that? Is there anything else we want to get in?  
The “latest” problem: if we’re releasing 2.x and 3.x close to each other in time, we should do 2.x first? This affects what shows as https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest and on the https://github.com/helm/helm highlighted as “Latest”.

With new 3-way merge, how about “helm restore” == “helm rollback <current>”? [Marc]
Fisher: rollback logic is intended to preserve any ad-hoc changes
Adam: upgrade a release passing in the same info - might be nice to have a “helm validate” to see if what’s in-cluster matches the release
Fisher: detect drifts in state
Adam: let user decide on best remedy
Joe Thompson: use cases to deal with drift - 1) keep changes 2) want easy undo
Fisher: find all the patches that helm does during an upgrade, take output, do selective logic?
Joe T: no, I just want to reset to a known state - either a patch or a reset
Adam: how does this differ from `helm delete && helm install`?
Joe T: will create an issue to delineate differences from past request
Fisher: a rollback is an upgrade using internal chart metadata, patching release with an old version’s info - usually going back one release

Helm 2 Triage Party [Paul, who has a conflict today]
Paul is putting together a Triage Party for Helm 2 to try finalize it out.  Suggested dates (best efforts for both US and EU times) at this doodle - https://doodle.com/poll/ke3vygaf75gmh53f.  I’d like to be decided before the next meeting.
Likely use Triage Party to organize.   We might want to look at using it longer term to help organize daily/weekly triage.  Example running on Paul’s k8s cluster - http://ad4d22aeea574488f86a87f53a180704-1568206551.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/s/v2
Expected timeline for 3.3? [Marc]
Currently for 3.4 but could be moved up:

Milestone: https://github.com/helm/helm/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A3.3.0
Matt Fisher: looking into this yesterday, some things waiting on reviews, others maybe need to be rethought. 
Josh: maybe do this on this call
Matt Fisher will bring up on the mailing list the need for a hard date to cut 3.3
Do we need a v2 release to merge v2 docs? [Bridget, who has a conflict today]
The PR in question: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8323
Trying to understand what the next steps are here
[fisher]: PRs just need to be merged to the dev-v2 branch and v2.helm.sh should rebuild itself from there
Matt Fisher: this should be resolved, unusual situation
Adding more labels to the release secret… https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8272 [Farina]
Discussion around the security concerns of this - a RBAC role that had just “List” on secrets would be given now extra information (chart name and version) which might be used to determine version used and find exploits
Josh: Can this be configurable?
Fisher: It would take a rethinking of storage implementation
Farina: maybe there is some other way to do this
V2 EOL tracking issue https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8343 [Farina]
Should we make tiller undownloadable (the container image)?

Some repos in https://github.com/helm/ haven’t been updated since 2018 - does someone want to mark them as archived? [Bridget]
Adam: some maybe - for others we might want to accept issues - we need to review them to see
Bugfixes for v2 were going to end May 13, but now they are planned to end Aug 13. That is less than 2 months away. Can we get some maintainer eyes on ones like https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7360? (7 open v2.x PRs; 16 open v2.x issues [Bridget]  
Paul C will organize a bug-bash cleanup party for 2.x
Subcommands for the completion command https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8314 [Marc] 
Who needs to be involved for this type of change?
Adam thinks this shouldn’t be an issue - think of it like the API - if it’s refactoring but no CLI changes that’s fine
Blocking contribution for Fish completion https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8111
Too late for 3.3?
Adam: Time to season isn’t as critical - we can review for 3.3 if it’s in soon
Marc: it’s also not super time-critical
`tpl` function is non performant for Umbrella chart which contains large number of sub-charts (120 in this case)
Ref to: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8002
Confirmed by Matt Butcher
Adam: the bug report was around performance 
Martin: listed as bug/help-wanted
Need reviewer on https://github.com/helm/acceptance-testing/pull/84 and feedback on https://github.com/helm/acceptance-testing/pull/81#issuecomment-643952826 [Predrag]
Marc looking at it in limited time
How to properly handle force-pushing in a review? [Marc]
Fisher: ends up being a full re-review - lacks context of what changed since last review
Adam: github allows squashing for more useful history later
Martin: multiple commits in a PR makes cutting the release challenging - squash at the end is helpful

Announcements (items of general interest like releases, requiring no discussion)
 Helm 2.16.8 was released yesterday [Fisher]
Security issue that affect 32-bit arch on older version of Go, CVE for 1.13.6 and below
 Helm 3.2.3 was released [Farina]
3.2.2 botched due to release hiccup, 3.2.3 has everything meant to be in 3.2.2 
CNCF webinar tomorrow - join and heckle! https://www.cncf.io/webinars/cncf-project-webinar-charting-your-voyage-to-helm-3/ [Bridget]
Tell your friends!

Discussion (Suggest five-minute discussions with a sentence or two about what you’d like to discuss, a link to the issue(s), and your name. Discussion suggestions may be moved to future weeks or GitHub, if warranted.)
The use of .Files.Get (and other methods) in templates from subcharts but being called in parents. What should the scope of .Files be? The subchart or the parent? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8266 [Farina]
.File.Get scoping is in whichever chart you are operating on
Will this break peoples current expectations
We should at least try to understand it and document current functionality
Afterwards, maybe we can take action on Helm 3. Need to ensure backwards compatibility so as not to affect older charts
Large release objects, again… https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8281 [Farina]
Wasn’t there an issue to remove manifests from release objects?
(Bridget adds: Do we want to finish https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/538/ https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/558 without the input of the original submitter, who is slow to reply? (We were waiting for the 3.2 release which has happened.))
Manifests are each base64 encoded, then gzipped. Can we just not base64 encode it so gzip could work better? [farina]
If we change underlying storage, it would break migration from 2-to-3 [martin]
People trying to use Helm as a higher-level tool (like Chef), we should document strategies [Farina]
This has been an issue for a long time, maybe there is something we can do to optimize the storage (i.e. double storing things)  [Adam]
Allow other storage backends? [Bridget]
3.3.0 release? [Farina]
Please maintainers, review PRs in the milestone
Link: https://github.com/helm/helm/milestone/89
Release candidate possibly next Thursday
New feature: Add external files to a chart install https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8227 requested in https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3276 [Vlad]
Probably not slated for 3.3, will add to 3.4.0 [Fisher]

BLM support statement for Twitter and/or Helm website [Karen]
Is this something we need to run past CNCF? [fisher]
Linkerd and Prometheus already have tweets [Bridget]
Discussion - all agree: We should check with the CNCF and follow their guidance. Bridget to follow up.
Discussion of changes in unit tests for chart fixtures [Adam Reese]
Continuing from last week
Adam will open an issue to continue the discussion
Wants to change the practices around test fixtures
How do we want to document the methods of Linux installs for the various distros? https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/641 [Matt Farina] 
Farina: Do we want to point to a startup’s installation that is not a well-known source?
Adam: we could use a link instead of copy-paste instructions.
Martin: we shouldn’t include a link if we’re unsure about the source
Farina: “reputation” is a squishy thing
Adam: even with homebrew we don’t control what goes into the installation process
Farina: is referencing a third party a recommendation of the third party? Helm is providing links to third parties, ymmv, not an endorsement.
Josh: do we want to release our own fpm, deb, rpm, etc? https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm
Adam: we had requests for snap, etc - hard to draw a line.
Farina: will take action to update install docs to say the Helm community and link (not copypasta)
Farina: Packaging matters but also working with every packaging system increases complexity.
Farina and Butcher - please ack if all points are clear now in https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8175 [Predrag]
Farina: I’ll look through it and consider - will look at implications
3.3.0: let’s set a date. [Bridget]
Farina: will start reviewing
Adam: add anything to milestone for next release
OCI: let’s get “install chart from registry” in. [Bridget]
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7613
#7613 does not implement this, but it's a prerequisite [Josh]
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6982
We sign release artifacts but nobody verifies the signatures! PR to add GPG verify in install script on Linux https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7944 [Josh]

Discussion of changes in unit tests for chart fixtures [Adam Reese]
Will talk again next week and maybe have a pattern
Referencing chart fixtures in other packages etc.
So Adam did a review and refactor
Smaller text fixtures and keep in memory - 
Martin suggests documenting some patterns of how we suggest doing this 
Goal: to reduce code bloat of unit tests
(Farina is out - carry over to next week) How do we want to document the methods of Linux installs for the various distros? https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/641 [Matt Farina] 
Followup from May 14th: There is a proposal around managing repository configuration in cluster; thoughts? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8175 [Predrag]
Predrag to reach out again on GH to Farina and Butcher
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7877 was closed but raises a possibility that would be nice to support of reusing the installed version of a chart [Joe Thompson]
Why specify the chart instead of the chart embedded in the release?
Taylor says we don’t have metadata for that, but we do have a proposal
Adam thinks this is possible, Martin not so sure
Joe is going to take a stab at a proposal
Making the best of Cobra 1.0 for completion https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8131 . How about a “Completion 101” session to get more maintainers up to speed? [Marc]
Patch gets rid of some overhead code and move to Cobra 1.0
To help get patch reviewed, Marc is willing to do a 101 session around completion
OCI topics [josh]:
Regression since 3.0.3, non-identical digests for identical charts:
Issue: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8212
PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8216
Larger issue pointed out by Matt Fisher, “`helm package` should produce bitwise-deterministic tar files”: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3612
Adam says this is probably a bug
When you tar something order of files are not guaranteed
Maybe sort files before performing tar
Could it be because of packaging dependencies also?
oci:// chart dependencies
PR: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7613
Josh looking for maintainers to review and get merged
“helm chart list” with large cache causes “too many open files” - issue+fix coming

Request for a role (moderator/notes) to upload recordings to youtube playlist [Jeff]
Fisher is working on this using automation around Splain	
The videos are uploaded as private and someone needs to make them public
Timeline of merging docs (helm-www) prior to a release? [Josh]
There was a case where docs were merged prior to a feature
We have a longer issue of versioning for docs we are looking for someone to help with
Suggestion, when a new feature is documented we should document the version it’s available in.
Martin suggested a GitHub milestone for docs.
Return ChartLoader Interface instead of the Chart Path when using LocateChart API. [Vibhav] https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7601
Fisher: additional context is required
Adam: will take a look
Farina: we will not change function signatures or returns, but old deprecated functions will remain
New helm options and/or removing klog flags [Marc]:
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8067
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8095
Grouping commands was reverted but Marc thinks the command grouping needs to be back in.
No urgency on making these changes
Needs to be reconciled with Adams other work.
I was looking into a bug about dependencies.enabled flag, which led me to find some code that didn't seem to get ported to v3 very well, which is corroborated by some of the other open issues. [Jeff]
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8155
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7908
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7389
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5780
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8118
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7993


 In the short term, I'd like to get some clarification if we should enable the enabled flag (https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8138 ) or instead remove it from the documentation.
Butcher has done some auditing - broken in several places
Butcher has blocked off a sprint to take a look into this once the lint work is in
A classic issue from Farina - Add Warning when installing or upgrading a deprecated chart #3724 [Bridget]
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3724 
fixed in v3 but the committer doesn’t seem to have come back to fix it in v2. 
Do we want this warning in before we stop making bugfix changes to v2, given that deprecations are bound to be common for v2 users over time?
If so, maybe we get a volunteer to backport the fix instead of waiting for that committer? (looks like Martin may have some context)
We agreed this should go into v2
[we ran out of time at this point]
Linux installs [Farina] https://github.com/helm/helm-www/pull/641 
Followup from the last week: Managing repository configuration in cluster https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8175 [Predrag not able to attend today], please share your feedback on the issue

make test-style seems to fail and be ignored on circle-ci https://circleci.com/gh/helm/helm/12123 [Marc]
Fisher will help; this is fixed on master for now according to Marc
Fisher says the warnings may need to be handled differently
Review needed for plugin loading refactor https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7906.  [Marc] Blocks:
Contribution https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8111 from a new contrib - blocked by existing PR (we should avoid breaking plugin completion)
Fish completion
Dropping the internal package “completion”
Improved custom completion (adding descriptions)
Upcoming improved Zsh completion (with descriptions)
Does someone have time to look at this now or pair with Marc?
Fisher and Marc will look at this together (Scott R may join as well)
Managing repository configuration in cluster (alternative to .config/helm/repositories.yaml), elevator pitch [Predrag]
At Red Hat they’ve been looking at options to store/read helm charts from a repo instead of a local file
Does this make sense for the community upstream?
Fisher: use case vs local fs?
Predrag: centrally administered configs
Fisher: similar projects exist 
Predrag: they’re complimentary but not the same - in this case, not forbidding local repos but want to whitelist an approved set of repositories - this pre-populates configuration
Farina: is the use case a read-only env? Or to help a new dev get running more quickly? (Yes)
Butcher: Also this eases sharing between teams of devs
Farina: helm fetch/install work with a URL without you needing to add the repository first, for CI use cases
Predrag: this is more to share pre-defined configuration for developers
Marc: centralizing repo choices for a cluster is good but then may be inconsistent between clusters.  This could actually be a feature, where only some repos are allowed for some clusters?
Farina: a typed secret could be better than a CRD, since some can’t use that. 
Rigby: also would the CRDs be namespaced? If not, doesn't that move away from the goal of moving helm from cluster-wide to namespace only?
Rigby: Also in general, doesn't this also move away from Helm's move to client-only? It sounds interesting in general, though my thought is similar to Matt Fisher's (related more to operator CRDs like fluxcd)
Pred: Will follow up with an issue
Artifact stability/OCI: where are we? Let’s make a checklist and get there - there are open issues but I don’t see a summary of the status. [Bridget]
Josh D: This was main part of OCI meeting discussion yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9WNkklCmuc
Josh: Farina was named - the OCI meeting said it needed a list from us of what it takes to remove the experimental flag
Bridget: yes - let’s figure out our plan/make sure it’s visible
Josh D: OCI dependency PR? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7613
Farina: is this a spec waiting for everyone to use it, or can it be depended on? (Is it “trusted” or “already there”?)
Farina: Distribution spec is concerned with container images. Is the artifact spec something we can stably rely on?
Josh: Helm will drive a lot of this - we could call it a best practices guide and say “this is how helm is using the API”
Farina: we’ll be going off the documented beaten path if we stick things that aren’t images in 
Fisher: Docker Distribution can be more compliant
Butcher: the main reason we don’t want to move the experimental flag off is that there is a lot of documentation to do because not all repositories are OCI-compliant and allow chart types. We shouldn’t remove an experimental flag and confuse average users.
Farina: The alternative option here is to discuss pulling the artifacts proposal out of OCI entirely and rely on chartmuseum/harbor to support that functionalit yBut then we lose out on those OCI compatibility guarantees we were touting at Helm 2
Josh: will take action to try to explain more clearly.

 Cutting 3.2.1 release

Discussion (include issue links and your name) (To ensure enough time for discussion items, we may not do a formal standup depending on the number of items. Please add discussion items as desired.)
Install charts with HELM_REPOSITORY_CACHE=off (vibhav)
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7545
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7601
The goal of this effort is to be able to run helm install/upgrade/template in a read-only file system. Kubernetes config would be injected via an injected volume (e.g., when running in a pod).
For this use case a full url or path would need to be passed to Helm to install. This would bypass registries.
How would this be tested? Do we need a test run in a read-only environment?
Might be useful for making chart-test github actions read only … and those would then help verify it works.
OCI - what are the steps to get off of experimental (josh)
Issues left before distribution-spec 1.0: https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/milestone/3
OCI charts as dependencies: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7613
Current registry support: https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/
[farina] the issue that’s a blocker is the lack of stability out of the OCI on storing artifacts. Will it change? What guarantees of a stable API are there? We are waiting on the OCI.
[josh] is interested in a better configuration experience other than environment variables. Possibly something like the way git does it.
The hold up isn’t the UX (which we could work on). It’s OCI artifact stability

Sprig uses merge-go which made a breaking change
Farina mentions an issue: https://github.com/imdario/mergo/issues/139

Discussion
Plan for the Security Story, it is a good time as this can be taken alongside the design of Notary v2. [Vibhav]
Pushed to next week (vibhav gone)
Thoughts on extending the support period for Helm 2, given that the global situation might be leading to code freezes and thus enterprises not moving off Helm 2 to Helm 3 with alacrity? [Bridget]
The original plan was bug fixes for 6 months after the Helm 3 initial release (ending May 13 2020) and a year of security fixes (ending Nov 13 2020)
Can we measure the number of Helm 2 users remaining (downloads, other metrics)?
Butcher: maybe lets push back bug fixes by about 3 months
All: agree
Action: blog post on helm.sh
Matt Farina + Bridget to take
Allow patching/updating CRD resources after first install (https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7735) [martin]
James Munnelly to pitch proposal
Push to next week (james gone)
Cache Drivers for Helm.
Pushed to next week (no link no vibhav)
[Ken Perkins] I’m hoping to discuss extensible labels for release artifacts (secret/configmap storage driver) as a way to have consistent labeling across all resources related to a release (useable with selectors), https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7007
Context - doing backup using Velero, needs more granular backup
Velero: https://velero.io/
The release driver for secrets plus configmaps is hardcoded
No ability, unilaterally, to get labels defined by user
Adam: there has been discussion on this previously
1. Policy on not wanting to touch resources, fully unopinionated
Haven't found clean way to do this
Jacob: There is a PR using annotations vs labels
Link: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7649
Merged but unreleased, in 3.2 milestone
Ken: annotations might not cover it
Adam: in favor of labels option being added, but was unable to find a clean way to do so previously
Matt Farina: this may be doable with postrenderers
Adam: labels - will make upgrade much easier

Notary / TUF compatibility or support ( how do we go about it ? ) [Vibhav]
Pushed from last week
Discussed with Radu on some of the design discussions around Notary/TUF support
Question raised to the call: are we looking to get the experimental OCI feature into a stable feature?
Josh D and others have been working on ORAS - works for arbitrary artifacts: https://github.com/deislabs/oras 
Josh D: “There is also an ongoing “notary v2” discussion going on in OCI #notary-v2 channel in CNCF slack”
Butcher: definition of stable: a security story, finalized OCI, community momentum
Farina: let’s not move-fast-break-things - real enterprises use Helm
Butcher: in summary, this would be a great time to talk about Notary/TUF support in the experimental OCI support, as that would be required for GA
Some PRs needing just a bit of attention:
Install / Template Charts without downloading to filesystem https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7601 needs small input @mattfarina [Marc]

Release 3.1.2? [Farina]
Will cut later today [probably by Farina] unless someone else get there first
Vision for HelmHub: how to choose the right chart for a product? [Marc]
The stable and incubator Helm chart repositories, currently listed on the Helm Hub, have begun a 1 year deprecation timeline. After 6 months they will be de-listed from the Hub (soon to be CNCF hub). See helm/charts > Status of the Project and Deprecation Timeline
The Helm Hub has a process for Adding distributed Helm repos, and the stable and incubator repos have a process for Deprecating a Chart once this is completed
Orgs and individuals can host distributed Helm repos however they wish, but if they want to use Helm-created tools (chart testing, releasing, etc) they can follow this example to use Helm Chart repo Actions: https://github.com/helm/charts-repo-actions-demo
There is a stub issue to help track migration, here https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/21103 (this will be fleshed out soon. While each deprecated chart README links to it's new home, this issue primarily to help the community see the migration at a glance)
We have engaged with a number of orgs who develop the apps to host charts for those apps (here is a working list that will be added to that github issue soon https://hackmd.io/VgK7_DUpS6CLLT4HSncmDg)
Helm.sh used to have a link to the sig-apps meeting recordings (not helm-specific) but now just points to https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/communication.md#meetings - do we have a specific link or playlist we want to publish for the Helm dev call? These get recorded - but where do people watch them? [Bridget] / Posting Helm dev call videos [Marc]
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVt9l4b66d5EY5Xs9OVJgvO5ss9WzrSY0

Discussion
Kubernetes broken versioning [Adam] https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7219
We rely on the libraries kubectl uses - and that no longer supports some old versions
Farina: this problem is going to keep happening/get worse (because the API server/kubectl won’t work with older versions)
Farina: should we add Helm lint rules around this?
Fisher: yes; we should give a warning/message in these cases
Adam: we could build a binary outside of helm for conversion

Contributing Guide? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7585 [discussion suggested by Bridget, based on issue opened by Matt Farina]

Vanilla `kubectl` can handle this, Helm needs to be able to diff against deprecated api to new api in cluster

Farina: maintainers who aren’t core maintainers could also sign up
Martin: new core maintainers can learn how to triage by pairing
Farina: let’s start by reinstating the role and writing docs
Add a “NEWS” file to help with release notes? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7581 [Marc]
Merge conflicts mean a single file is a challenge
Adam suggests an update to the github template
Fisher will link to another tool that helps.
What versions of Helm should be in docs? https://github.com/helm/helm-www/issues/497 [mattfarina]
Fisher: Ronan added version dropdown list between individual versions - 2.14 does not have a specific need to be on there
Adam: we’re constantly changing docs (not synced with specific versions)
Farina: k8s does it with each minor release but each release is a breaking change - let’s remove the process and just have “helm 2” and “helm 3” but in helm 3 docs, specify minor version when the change came in
Adam - include a section for anything that’s changed in the docs
Fisher: bring it back to Ronan
Farina: will continue convo with Ronan

Scott Morgan: I’ve had a PR sitting around for a while. Looking to find a core maintainer to move this around (7060)
Martin: how come the apiVersion had to be updated? `helm lint` should work with older chart APIs

Travis raines: https://github.com/helm/chart-testing/issues/202
Taylor: I’ll have to dig into this one a little more. --wait can be a bit of a finicky thing and can’t tell what’s the issue immediately

Butcher: I’ll review this offline
Should helm env show XDG paths? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6892 Result of offline discussion between Farina and Adam? [Marc]

Discussion
When should we cut the 3.1.0 RC? (Farina, Bridget)
RC 3.1 tomorrow (Feb 7) - Farina willing to cut the release
Release 3.1: tentatively, Feb 13
RC 3.2 March 11, release March 18
One last sync up on post render [Taylor]
Farina considered this to be for one-off scripts and trying to understand use case
Martin: this capability has some inherent risks - perhaps we should document more than restrict
Farina wants a good pattern for this; Taylor is going to comment/explain future enchancements.
What should we do with https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6794? [Taylor]
Namespace mechanism is more declarative than before - but might be okay? [Taylor]
Farina: you’re moving namespace choices from one role to another with this change
Fisher: The role conflicts aren’t fixed by this PR - the lookup functionality is the same.
Farina suggesting an opt-in flag for auto-creation
Adam: it was a much-desired feature to limit releases to a namespace
Should helm-plugin-utils (https://github.com/maorfr/helm-plugin-utils) be moved to Helm org? [Maor/Martin]
Fisher: is this a Helm2-only plugin? If so we’d want that to be clear
Farina: there is no license on this repo yet
Should helm env show XDG paths? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6892 [Marc]
Marc: XDG paths get default values when no set, which are hard to discern
Farina: debugging is difficult for XDG - this workaround would make our lives easier
Adam: XDG is unix/linux specific, so we probably want to call this “config root directory” or some such
Farina: we have an issue about setting locations - the ability to use multiple path separators doesn’t currently work
Adam & Farina will follow up offline
Update on --name flag https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7345 [Marc]
Marc: Farina noted that many READMEs mention this
Fisher: core maintainers are making design decisions - we’ll listen but not change based on one community member’s opinion

Let’s discuss a date for 3.1.0 (Farina)

Taylor: let’s make sure the k8s libraries are updated
Yes: Joe Langford did this
Fisher: let’s check a few regressions, but yes, this could work
Farina: by the call next week, we’ll know when we can cut the RC
Fisher: will put some PRs for discussion in the helm dev channel
Prettify Updated time in helm ls [Martin]: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7024
Breaking change or not?
Helmsman (a 3rd party tool) is consuming the table and the time
Potential path forward:
Move to local timezone and remove the fraction of a second. It’s same format with difference in accuracy
See what this means for helmsman and parsing the information
Would be nice for ls and history to be consistent
Dependency digest differs between Helm 2 and 3: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7261 [Martin]
Need review and feedback if right approach
Fisher: consistent calculation?
Farina: there is a complication around dependencies with v1 vs v3 of library
Martin: some reverse engineering of hash
Farina will review
Update on --name flag https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7345 [Farina]
Farina: lots of charts use this - we can make it a hidden flag
Fisher: Helm 3’s refactoring of argument/flag parsing is less complex so this is more straightforward for the CLI - we still have to look at the SDK (might be okay)
Farina: we’re less worried about the SDK and more about copypasta
3tutorials
Taylor: let’s be careful of precedent
Fisher: let’s assert this is a case-by-case decision, and not a precedent
Farina: a valid case exists here, and they get a deprecation message. This isn’t a “we support it forever” scenario.

Question about SA by default in `helm create`. Is it considered a good practice for every workload to run on its own SA even before RBAC resources are needed (PR where this was added), and if so, why? [Scott]:
Curious what practice why to create a SA everytime for deploy a chart
Farina said he reviewed this and he thought this pattern was being used commonly in the chart repo
No chart maintainers chimed in when Farina asked
Scott will raise an issue if it needs a change
Upgrade from failed releases: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5595 [Martin]
Several issues - releases can get into a state that can’t move on; people can be using deprecated APIs
We’ll have this issue for open a while, for discussion
Jacob to add comment on how this can fail on first attempt to deploy
Reintroducing --name flag? https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7345 [Farina]
Martin: we need to be cautious about deprecation now that the (metaphorical) horse has bolted - the release is out.
Marc agrees with Martin’s opinion
Farina to add a comment to the PR that we have broken compatibility which is allowed. There is a way to work on this.
Could set a precedence of adding back in deprecated items which is not a great idea

Farina: Hosting elsewhere could cause a trust issue depending on who - we’d want to be clear that it’s a third party
Martin: choice is between running it ourselves and pointing to a third party
Farina: Point out to them that this is third party and he is totally responsible (unless we have maintainers who want to take it on with him)
3.0.3 and 3.1.0 releases? [Farina]

Big patch (discussion topic to follow)
Discussing with Fisher about working with memory driver
Hoping to pre-load it with something (but doesn’t handle namespaces - worried about API compat)
We can add but cannot alter methods
Butcher thinks this is an oversight/bug

Ping him if you need him on specific PRs
Discussion
Auto-completion re-written in Go https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7323 [Matt Farina]
Moving it to Go lets us remove kubectl as a dependency
Request: please take a look/review this - it’s a big change
Fisher will be taking a look & put it on the 3.1 milestone
What should be done about the version on master? "unreleased" is currently not being added [Marc]
Marc was unsure how to post a version to show something would be off master - like “3.0 unreleased” like it used to.
Fisher explains he & Adam refactored the internal version packaging so the stable release would not have “unreleased” hardcoded
Fisher: In the makefile there’s a way to specify “unreleased” when not being built from a tag - we should add that (back).
Action item for Fisher: open an issue explaining the problem and suggested solution
Handle CRD ingress resources https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5574 [Matt Farina provided feedback]
Farina commented on this last May but uncertain why it’s on this list today
Martin added it today, to see if we can give a more complete answer now
Farina says we need more eyes on work that will affect CRDs - they’re still challenging
community charts Helm 3 backwards compatibility is complete (to the best of our knowledge). Does anyone know of other issues that have since come up that aren't listed here? https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/19008 [Scott]
Fisher: that is a pretty comprehensive issue list
Hook up Linux s390x as CI platform: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7096 [Martin]
Submitter was asking about hooking a particular test into our CI pipeline
Farina mentions github actions and “self-hosted runners” as an option
Martin wonders if we _want_ this to be automated
Fisher points out that the ARM architecture testing was hosted by a third-party community project (without official support) - could we have the community members who are interested in s390x do the testing?
Martin mentions that we aren’t automatically running other platforms’ tests either.
Fisher: the same argument can be made for PPC arch
Butcher: the problem with new architectures: we cannot guarantee reliability on archs that the core team can’t access
Farina: so, we document to avoid confusion
K8s 1.16 and deprecated APIs: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7219 [Martin]
Martin: This is going to be a big issue for people in production
A community member might work on a plugin for this (like the helm 2to3 plugin)
This is going to be messy - there’s no clean delineation
Fisher: other issues like migration of one chart from an older to newer api version - k8s upgrades objects from 1.15 to 1.16, so making it easier for release objects would be good
Farina: other issues are coming - helm upgrade *should* allow All The Things to work (if we can find a way)
Bridget: can we recommend replace instead of upgrade?
Fisher: we should look at the k8s strategy for API version upgrades - this is going to happen with ingress and more
Martin: we’ll keep an eye on this

CNCF webinar on Helm 3 w/ maintainers next Tuesday (Jan. 14)
https://www.cncf.io/webinars/a-conversation-about-helm-3/
Standup
Marc
Cobra help text on stderr has been reverted to stdout
What is the “needs pick” process?
Fisher: release triaging for next patch release, tracking what’s been cherry-picked into patch branch
Taylor:
Step 1 -> Add to correct milestone.
Step 2 -> Add the “needs pick” label to the PR
Working on shell completion
Taylor
Post-render PR tidying, getting feedback addressed
Josh
Closed a few chartmuseum bugs
Matt Butcher
PR - making sure we don't use old directories.
Discovery client: make sure last set of fixes work
If you had stale API endpoint declared, it failed to initialized, causing chart rendering to fail
Martin
PR reviews, looking at defects
Looking at Taylor’s proposal
Scott
In a large room
Helm actions work, working with orgs to move charts from community repo to use their own, using action when possible
Jacob
Helm rollout logs, adding more watchers for readiness. Getting more logs to the end user without having to use kubectl
Bridget
Helm 101 content for upcoming workshops, getting it into a repo for anybody to run
Matt Fisher
Panel next week Tuesday w/ other maintainers
https://www.cncf.io/webinars/a-conversation-about-helm-3/
PR reviewing
Feedback on issue queue, making sure things are triaged
Figuring out what's the story w/ 2.16.2 and 3.0.3, as well as 3.1.0 release


Discussion
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/6752 needs some reviews [Taylor]
We should discuss its behavior with `helm template`
Butcher: the right thing to do is to throw errors vs. default values
Taylor: are we ok w/ this?
FIsher: curious if this solves anyones issues
Taylor: maybe post-render is the better option
Martin: we may not want this capability
Taylor: this feels like --wait - took 2 years to make it work properly, so we should be cautious
Bridget: lets not surprise people in unpleasant ways
https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7260 [Taylor]
Updates on this proposal
Need to decide on how long we should leave open for comment
Fisher: Is there a precedent in other orgs (python) for long features left open for discussion?
Post-render hooks - the ability to add in extra resources after the fact
Bridget: “we are putting the burden of repeatability on the end user to ensure they are using the correct post-renderer every time” is this going to be okay given sufficient docs?
Taylor: will probably leave open for 2 weeks
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7320 [Taylor]
When migrating from 2 to 3, when moving CRDs to crd/ directory, their CRDs will be deleted.
We’ve always said (in docs etc.) we will not delete CRDs
Taylor: rather user angry over not working, vs. things being deleted w/out their knowledge
Auto-completion re-written in Go https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7323
