Fixing bugs in v2 & v3 [mattfarina]
For features - if they do not affect Helm 3, we consider merging
If it solves for Helm 2 and 3, asking contributors if they are willing to add these things for Helm 3
Bugs - will be merged
System wide plugins [mattfarina]
SUSE wants to add this for envs that are unable to install plugins
Can be handled by https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
Adam: this is on Helm 3 project board , XDG configuration
Given the increasing agenda length, if we are going to stick to a 30min call, maybe we should skip the Standup section? Alternatively do we need an hour call?  [henrynash]
Fisher: there was discussion on the cncf-helm-cartographers mailing list about everyone writing out their standup and dedicating the 30 minutes to discussion. If the standup topic requires input, it can be added to discussion items.
Standup is good to give people chance to speak up, get people engaged
Stef: comes to meeting to keep up with what were up to, also to be involved

Helm v3 Status
Discussion
Fixing bugs in v2 & v3 [mattfarina]
What is the success criteria for going back to one issue triager? [bacongobbler]
Will follow up in cncf-core-maintainers mailing list
At what point can we reasonable close an issue for being stale/having no activity? From last week’s convo, we decided not to have a bot automatically close issues, but can we decide on a time limit that a triager can use. 6 months? 8 months? 1 year? [mnoorali]
System wide plugins [mattfarina]
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/4871 [mattfarina]
CRD lifecycle - Helm and deleting CRDs (doesn’t today) and CRD lifecycle [mattfarina]
The crd-install hook only deals with the install lifecycle but there are open issues IRT CRDs with Helm. How should we approach this?
Adam: we don’t do lifecycle management around CRDs because CRDs can be shared across multiple charts, so if we delete a CRD on a `helm delete`, then we could delete a CRD that could be dependent on other charts
James: I agree, but with the introduction of the annotation, we’ve seen weird behaviour where if someone has created a CRD prior to a `helm install`, the CRD will get removed before being installed. We’re trying to figure out what we can do to make the situation better for istio/cert-controller
Adam: I haven’t dug too deep into the CRD APIs, but perhaps an action item we can do is observe the behaviour how the Kubernetes API handles CRDs outside of Helm, and determine the expected behaviour? Perhaps even a few concrete use cases
Mortent: would it be valuable to add a proposal for the solution in Helm 3?
James and Adam: yeah, this might affect Helm 3 as well so if there are fixes that need to happen there we should get that in
At IBM we have several hundred charts, and I hear this issue of CRD quite a lot - I’ll do a review and see if I can bring requirements to the table [henrynash]
<heresy>Given the increasing agenda length, if we are going to stick to a 30min call, maybe we should skip the Standup section?</heresy> [henrynash]
Adam: should we talk about this in 2 weeks at next standup?
Henry - happy with that
Given we are entering a period of large new features for helm, would it be beneficial to formally articulate/document how new features should be agreed for inclusion? Many open source projects have a spec repo (e.g.: https://github.com/openstack/keystone-specs), where the PR for a spec getting merged means that the feature and its architectural implementation is agreed. I guess our equivalent is the helm/community/proposals|helm-v3 ? However, it is not clear how such things really get accepted, what’s the threshold for sign off by maintainers etc. [henrynash] (let’s defer this to 2 weeks time)
PR #4871? [farina & fisher]
Adam: Let’s follow up offline

Discussion
Helm v3 repository topics [jdolitsky]
Community proposal #55 - merging helm repos and docker registries
The basis of this proposal is for helm repositories to mimic the docker registry API more closely
Looking on what is the right way to build it out further
Jimmy: the problem I see is the backwards compatibility for the pre-existing repository system (referring to Helm 2 repositories)
Fisher: the other issue comes in the form of OCI mediaType incompatibility (you can’t helm push quay.io/bacongobbler/helloworld and docker push quay.io/bacongobbler/helloworld)
The quay implementation restricts repositories to a single mimetype to avoid this problem, but that has UX tradeoffs
Follow-up: let’s set up a call to discuss this meeting (assigned to Josh Dolitsky)
Community proposal #57 - Helm 3: push, login, capabilities api

edX course… anyone interested in doing it? CNCF has $$ [Matt Farina]
University-like material for education on Helm
Taylor: I might be interested in it but not sure about the timeframe is on that
Farina: let’s talk about this offline, but this opportunity just came up
Should helm login support basic auth in addition to oauth? [Matt Farina]
Adam: I’m not sure how difficult it’d be to add that in
Farina: so we should probably support an oauth mechanism out of the box for now
Helm container image? What base image (scratch, alpine, etc?) [Matt Farina]
Tiller uses alpine, so we should probably re-use that
Follow-up question: should we also push tiller images to quay/dockerhub?
I think we’re at an acceptable time to push to both gcr and quay using CircleCI
Linkerd2 has a different way to inject sidecars. How can we do this with Helm today? [Matt Farina]
Adam: yeah, I don’t think we could accommodate this today, essentially linkerd2 needs to stream-edit the chart as it’s being applied
Farina: could the event changes in Helm 3 help accommodate this?
Adam: theoretically, yes
Farina: perhaps it would be good to sit down with the linkerd folks

Non-core maintainers
Martin Hickey
Is it true that the Helm 3 codebase has been locked down to core maintainers?
(adam) yeah, there’s a ton of refactoring going on in the core codebase, but there are a couple areas where help would be appreciated (documentation, testing infra possibly?)
In terms of docs, what areas can we help?
(adam) I’m currently looking at sharing some documentation around what’s changed, possible opening a github project to show what’s being worked on/what’s done/what’s in the backlog
Markdown docs are stale in dev-v3, so updating the README or jumping into existing project work (docs site, CI infra, repository API working group)
Discussion
Encrypting secrets for sites and services [Matt Farina]
Org maintainers - congrats! You are now responsible for the following [Josh]:
Maintaining the mission, vision, values, and scope of the project
What is it that Helm trying to solve? (mission)
Where does Helm start and end? (scope)
How will we get there? (vision)
What do we need to embrace in order to succeed? (values)
Refining the governance and charter as needed
What can we do to make this process ultra-efficient?
How do move fast and not break things?
Making project level decisions
How can we make sure people have necessary info in order to confidently vote?
Which type of decisions are made at the subproject level? (eg. choice of CI, language, etc.)
Resolving escalated project decisions when the subteam responsible is blocked
What are the respective subteams?
Who will be primary points of contact for each?
Managing the Helm brand
Websites, logos
Documentation
Tutorials and evangelism
Twitter, social media, etc.
?
Controlling access to Helm assets such as source repositories, hosting, project calendars
Which tools will we use managing and sharing credentials?
Handling code of conduct violations
Violators will be publicly executed with a 2/3 vote
Deciding what sub-groups are part of the Helm project
Should this divide into more than just subprojects? (eg. testing committee)
Overseeing the resolution and disclosure of security issues
Majority of issues would related to Kubernetes in Helm 3
Does CNCF have a process in place for this?
Managing financial decisions related to the project
What types of things might cost money?
How does being a CNCF project relate to this?
Can companies or individuals contribute?
How can we ensure that the direction of the project cannot be “bought”?

Discussion
Chart packaging system improvements (@gintas) Please see https://hackmd.io/Q8dyCyztRmW4_Xz9UFwuMQ
Farina: what about the forking model? If you fork the chart and not change the ID (an implied change of this proposal), which cached version wins? You’ve got a non-reproducible cache pollution issue.
The question becomes “how do we do caching/forking with this model?”
We could run a hash on the chart and map it to that, perhaps
Josh: hashing may be a problem with relative file path links in requirements.yaml (charts can change on disk)
Farina: I’m not seeing what particular problems this proposal is trying to solve. Is there a human-readable write-up on the problem at-hand?
Action item: reach out and follow up with @gintas on the core problem without trying to come up with a solution
https://quay.io/helmpack/chart-testing/ is now public and we are archiving logs for long term via https://github.com/mattfarina/query-store-quay-logs (to be moved to the helm org after elections). But, only archiving aggregated stats (e.g., total pulls per day) rather than details because detailed as usernames mapped to IPs and other data. Thoughts?
Fisher: does the CNCF have any policies/thoughts on statistics for CNCF projects (e.g. any policies that came out of devstats.cncf.io)?
Farina: good question. I’ll follow up with them
Adam and Matt: probably good to just track general trendlines rather than deep personal data on users.
Josh: can we move the ChartMuseum image over to the quay repository?
Farina: yeah!
Travis Foster: hey, I’ve been looking into JSON parsers for Helm 3
https://github.com/helm/community/issues/49
Farina: thank you for taking a look into this! We’re looking for ways to looking into performance gains we can do with parsers so this is helpful.

Discussion
Estimating the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow
Bumped to next week
Should we use something like https://github.com/ericchiang/k8s instead of client-go for helm v3? (Farina)
Client-go has some well known pain points
Butcher: is it still being maintained?
Not sure
Would it be practical to use an alternative client to client-go in helm 3?
Butcher tried it. His findings:
Pervasive change
Eric made some really insightful changes but that create a somewhat cumbersome experience
For example, pointer to all the fields
This is the approach that apache thrift took
To use this library, some things are more cumbersome for the user
Some parts of the library didn’t feel 100% done
Pros: dep ensure took like 5 seconds
Adam: what is driving this?
Farina: Making upgrades easier. This is the time to make breaking changes, so let’s entertain the idea.
Adam: will take a look at it this week
Docker Hub vs alternatives for public image distribution (Farina)
On the charts side, we are going to distribute the chart testing library. Been thinking about where is the right place to store it and point people to.
Went out on the email list
Butcher: DOCKERHUB
Quay will tell us if there are vulnerabilities
Michelle: security is nice. Cool.
Fisher: DockerHub seems to be ubiquitous
Deis Workflow had a tough time trying to figure out metrics like image download count. Didn’t know if it was actually accurate.
Metrics not a blocker if the discoverability is the primary driver for this.
What is the best place to store images to get metrics?
Metadata points in ACR but it’s not public so it’s not an option
A wild Taylor appears in the meeting
Is DCO required for a PR with a CLA that was submitted before the DCO took place?

Someone at istio was being blocked with https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3805
Adam: this would be a major breaking change to how Tiller works for Helm 2, but it could be a possibility for Helm 3
There are a ton of edge cases around the different merge strategies
Farina: what about server-side apply?
Adam: same problem, it would be a very large technical challenge to manage different upgrade strategies for Helm 2
Discussion
Question: how does helm plan to address auto-generated configuration on `helm install`? E.g. autogenerated passwords in the postgres chart
Farina: we should come up with a convention.
Butcher: I would guess doing a pre-install hook to install a Configmap to autogenerate a password and place it in there
DCO?
Butcher: DCOs require all commits need to be signed?
Adam and Farina: yes
https://github.com/mattfarina/brigade-test-project/pull/1
https://github.com/probot/dco
Farina: asking michelle if they can pair on this on Monday?
Michelle: yes
Helm v3 or hub: enforce or notify if immutability changed?
Farina: if the digest changes, should we notify if someone broke
This is referring to changing an existing chart in-place, not bumping the version
Michelle in chat: then yes, we should put a warning in
Adam: the one thing we may want to think about is when charts are in development.
Farina: we could do a digest diff on a `helm repo update`?
Farina: we should probably think this one through
“helm login” - How do we envision this to work? Anybody interested in a call to address this in detail?
Josh will put out an email to discuss this topic
Butcher: can we start on the next Helm release since k8s 1.11 support is done and we have a few minor features committed already?
Fisher: sure
Butcher: there’s a lot of people asking for it, so we should cut an RC
Taylor: we should go through the PR queue before we cut an RC as there’s been a few requests

Discussion
Longer meeting? Should we start 30 min earlier?
Are we letting meetings run long because we don’t do well time-boxing items, or do we just have a lot of agenda items.
There seems to be more material to discuss. With Helm 3 and the hub, there is more “stuff” to discuss.
Should https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/4473 be thrown into the release branch and cut rc.4, or cut v2.10.0 without it?
[Taylor] would prefer to see a 2.10.1 with this fix in it

Update strategy in helm v3. See issue #3805 (michelle)
Adam’s been working a bit on a prototype to evaluate this. Pretty close to spiking it out, when he should have a better idea about this.
`--strict` flag on `helm repo update` to return non-zero exit code on failure PR #4348
<Hard to figure context on this, so let’s discuss in helm-dev>
Release Helm 2.10.0 today after merging PR #4364? (fisher)
Already discussed cutting an RC3 before doing a 2.10.0
Release without Adam’s patch for k8s 1.11. Doing so would break semver, so we shouldn’t do this.

When we left k8s we lost auto-sizing, have been figuring out how to bring the sizing back. Chris is going to try and chase down how to use ProBot so that we can get some of this back.
Working on update notifications -- how to tell folks that they have a helm update for them.
Discussion
Can folks (non core-maintainers) add/remove labels on the helm/helm repo right now? (michelle)
Non-core shouldn’t have access to do this.
There used to be a bot that we could use. The automation in place used to be able to allow folks to do this, but it was k8s specific.
Helm proposals
Installing custom plugin sets:
(Taylor) Two thumbs up
How do we do version handling? How do we discover the version.
(Butcher) It might be good to not even handle versions for a first pass
Helm v2 repositories
https://github.com/helm/community/pull/27
Two file approach -- idea is to do this to improve performance so that we’re able to do a lazy fetch
If you use a relative URL, don’t you lose context of the base URL?
If you have it in more than one URL the relative URL works across http / https.
Are we going to host keywords / maintainers from the current charts repo into the top-level file? How do we consider what is latest? (eg. 5.1.3 vs 5.1.4-alpha1).
We might want to change it from “latest” to “stable” to address this
Improved signing
https://github.com/helm/community/pull/20
Generate GPG keys for you so that you can sign charts (default is on). Move closer to making verification a part of the helm repo experience.
Main thing here is whether storing the public key is okay to store in the charts or not.
We don’t need to take an external dependency on GPG -- go already has libs that we use (already in the code).

Governance
Matt Farina's proposal for a new governance structure
https://hackmd.io/s/B1BksVYW7#
Bootstrapping process for project maintainer elections
Still need to figure out how to do this fairly and equally
Project maintainers need to be codebase maintainers
A codebase maintainer may not want to/be suitable to be a project maintainer
Codebase maintainers have skin in the game and care about the project direction
Codebase maintainers don't need to be software engineers, Helm has a history of maintainers that didn't contribute software but have contributed in other ways
Experience matters here, want ideas and psychology to bubble up to project maintainership
Don't want to end up with top-down maintainership
Sub-projects have a lot of freedom in adding maintainers - simple majority vote
Action: Make it more explicit that codebase maintainers don't need to be software engineers
Okay to have an even number of project maintainers for a short amount of time, if someone steps down before replacement found
Maintainers only removed if they become unresponsive
Bootstrapping project maintainers
Different weights for different projects?
Ghost period for code maintainers should be shorter?
Set an upper limit, but let codebases choose lower limits if desired
CNCF CoC - email contact in the CoC doc
Better nomenclature for project & codebase maintainers - repo & org maintainers?

Discussion
Moving docs [Matt Farina]
Docs repo?
Currently docs live in the helm repo itself.
Would be nice to add translation, etc.
Keeping this in mind does it make sense to move docs to their own repo?
Markdown vs Asciidoc:
Conversation with a few other folks about this:
Markdown is more popular, asciidoc is more technical?
There are tools that can switch between the two.
Example of kube-builder http://book.kubebuilder.io
Nice to be able to do side-by-side code and docs.
Built in i18n with gitbook
[Taylor]: In support of moving the docs to own repo
[Michelle] Helm v2 vs v3 docs -- will they live in the same repo in different directories?
Docker compose does a good job of splitting out the docs for different versions.
Gitbook vs other tool? https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/4100
Multi-lingual
K8s recommended labels. Do we switch? When? https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8703 [Matt Farina]
Helm has standard labels, almost one:one with the ones listed here, but having different names.
What is the best way to proceed here?
Adding annotations makes sense, but labels changes people’s deployments so the change is more intensive.
Governance esp w.r.t related projects:
Separation of concerns project maintainers vs. codebase maintainers
CNCF projects are expected to follow standard set of CI / Automation practices. (https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en) We will probably need to get to a certain state on this in the future.

Discussion on k8s 1.11 support for Helm
Update on current state of k8s 1.11 backwards incompatibilities
Generated Go code in k8s/k8s has been removed, making it unusable as a package: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62432
Removed the client-side reaper in favour of the server-side reaper. Because Helm prior releases, we need that for 1.10 support
The entire factory/builder packages in kubernetes/kubernetes were rewritten and are totally different between 1.10 and 1.11
The printer was rewritten and requires significant refactoring
Proposal (adam): due to backwards incompatibility and significant engineering effort, I propose Helm 2 only supports Kubernetes 1.10, punting k8s 1.11 to Helm 3
Another option: remove k8s/k8s as a dependency, and vendor the k8s 1.10 code directly into Helm 2 as a crutch
Apparently service catalog has already gone with this approach
Butcher: (giving some context on kube-lego and cert-manager) I don’t think we should go with solution 1. It puts our community in a bad position: Helm 3 isn’t ready, and Helm 2 would be in limbo
Adam: ok, I can go take a look at forking kubernetes/kubernetes so we have the packages for handling backwards compatibility
Farina: I’m going to take these issues up to SIG Architecture and SIG Release
Michelle (in chat): you think we should bring this up in SIG apps and see what other tools might be struggling with changes from this kubernetes release?
Farina: on the agenda for next SIG Apps
Fisher: Do we want to have a strategy for communication with the community for this? Farina: Better to over-communicate than under.
Adam: Go/no-go by end of the week. Farina: based on this we can craft some messaging to the community next week.

Helm 3 tickets
There’s been a few tickets raised on Helm 3 topics; are we ready for these?
Answer: no, redirect users to #helm-dev or the helm/community proposals at this point
Things are expected to break (and break often); we’re not ready feedback until the first alpha release
Zoom issues - people on hold?
The meeting moderator now needed to allow folks explicitly into the meeting, and folks are on hold until the moderator allows them in
Farina: Default k8s settings for zoom are changing to make things much more restrictive, and moderators need to explicitly let people in. This is around the push to stop bad actors, but meeting chairs need to keep an eye out for folks trying to join.
It might be effective to have co-hosts so that we can have multiple people keeping an eye out to let people on hold to join in.

Helm and CNCF [Matt Farina]
After last week’s incident, we are going to be stricter with how we can handle this in the k8s community. Sorry to all about last week’s incident, but we should now be in a better place to handle something like this if it happens on a CNCF community call again.

Fisher

Hoping to take a look at Helm3 discussions and get involved with that this week
Discussion
(Taylor) Wait-flag returning true if the app can’t start. Not sure if it’s worth it to keep the --wait flag around. Want to get input from community, and maintainers on whether it is a good idea to remove this. (Farina) On the community charts side, they had to write their own solution, but something like the wait flag is a better solution. Do understand the brittle nature of it, but it is useful. (Adam) There is a effort upstream that we might be able to piggy-back on (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64034)  -- so we might be able to leverage some of that. Maybe we should review what’s going on there, and get caught up on discussions. (Fisher) What’s the status of wait flag on v1? (Farina) There’s a storage bug that’s preventing old API versions from being removed. Hopefully that will be solved so that we don’t need to support older versions of the API / deployments? Probably a good idea to see in what direction the upstream effort is going before making an informed call here.

Proposal idea for how we want to do releases [JTT]
The dev call after the release is the next (bootstrap) call for the next release.
Each dev call have a 5/10 minute discussion for features where we discuss whether we pull merged PRs into the next release of a later release.
Is this adding unnecessary process which will be overhead for us?
Taylor will write up the process and make a PR to Helm to kick off more discussion for next week.
Distributed charts vs central hosting vs a combo [Matt Farina]
Charts Office Hours are at 9am PST 10 am Mountain on Tuesdays
Whole lot of work to curate charts and get people to curate charts and maintain. People tend to get burnt out. So the central repo model doesn’t really scale that well.
PHP packages have distributed hosting -- can we have some sort of distributed mechanism to do a similar thing for charts that is distributed, but has a central discovery -- so central metadata, with the actual charts living off in a different location.
More discussion next week
That _is_ a different project, so technically they would make a decision on this, but we should weigh-in during Charts office hours

Discussion
Issue Sherpa’ing with a second person was really good -- maybe we should institute a buddy system
When do we open up ‘the branch’ (referring to v3 branch)?
Few things to consider - How to handle feature requests coming in.
Bugfixes, do we need to cherry-pick bugfixes into both? How do we deal with this since it looks pretty different (eg. no longer protobufs, no longer generated code, etc)
How / when do we define a freeze for Helm v2 features?
Lots of folks still using Helm 2
(Fisher) Maybe have a window (of a couple weeks or so) where we allow features for Helm 2, after which we only allow features in Helm 3. (Farina) Maybe have a cutoff date which we tell contributors about?
(Michelle) Some folks might want to continue with Helm v2 and not Helm v3.
Adam is pointing out concern for the end user vs concern for contributors.
Michelle is in favor of a helm 2 feature freeze date. Will use labels to track incoming features to make sure they get mapped to helm 3
“1. Window for getting in feature requests before the v3 requirement
2. Labeling features in Helm 2 that we need to forward-port, so we can track those”
Issue sherpas can respond to Helm 3 branch PR requests appropriately.
Let’s schedule Josh’s demo for next week, for lack of time.

How do we respond to semver issues like this (Michelle)
If you use the kubeversion field and you have a constraint like >=1.8.0 this becomes incompatible with GKE’s versioning.
How do we respond / have we responded to these kinds of issues in the past.
One of the solutions was to add something like -r0 and making it pre-release (Farina might know more about this option -- this might be something that CoreOS/Rancher do)
There are over 300 open issues and over 80 open PRs. Should we do a week or two of having two sherpas to help clean out the backlog after 2.9.0 goes out? (Michelle)
(Taylor) Issues might not be much of a problem -- but we should definitely look into getting people to jump on and close PRs. The issue queue tends to self manage especially with fetja-bot and us noticing when things go stale.
(Fisher) It would be nice to make the community a bit more self-sustainable. Fully agree with prioritizing PRs over issue queue.
(Michelle) Do we want to have a dedicated person looking at PRs?
Taylor volunteered, but was decided not to make it a formal role just yet.
Vote on combined maintainers mailing list here (Michelle)
Two options right now (suggestions welcome!):
charts-and-helm-maintainers@lists.cncf.io
helm-cartographers@lists.cncf.io
(Adnan) Discussion on charts collecting analytics - https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/issues/4697
Heads up that this discussion is happening - folks interested please join in at the next charts call where this will probably come up.
(Fisher) One considerations is that Helm install doesn’t have a really good way of notifying the users that some analytics are being enabled -- this is especially true especially in the case of dependent charts. (Adnan) The dependency chart might be a problem since the parent chart could set the on/off flag and users might not necessarily know about it.
(Fisher) It would be nice to make it blatantly obvious that we were turning on analytics (eg. homebrew, etc.).
(Kensey) CoreOS has one flag for all projects to turn off analytics -- would be good to standardize

Uploaders for Plugins [Josh D]
How to implement ‘helm push’
Farina: I was thinking of doing it over http/https downloaders, so that plugins can implement custom push uploaders.
Josh: See #18 on the community repo, which could also provide indexers to tackle search scale issues, maybe others.
Farina: Some survey questions are relevant to this. I’d like to keep push and index separate so that we might be able to do push in Helm 2. Index is more complex/debatable.
Josh: Maybe make chart museum method the default, and allow plugins to override
Fisher: jFrog is also interested, maybe in basic auth because that’s the only available kind
Farina: Maybe we should ship with oauth support and token auth too
Josh: What if we don’t have a default implementation?

Branch naming for Helm 3 [Butcher]
Tentative plan is to have a place for Helm v3 code to land prior to KubeCon EU (beginning of May).
We had some ideas on how we want to branch for v3. Farina and Butcher looked at data and found a substantial amount of folks cloning helm master.
Normal weekday 150 - 180 unique cloners.
Points to not breaking master and leaving as is. => v3 code should live in a different branch.
‘v3’ is as good a name as any for the branch name.
Farina: We should think about how the branch name plays with dependency management tools like glide, dep, etc.
Butcher: Maybe we should do something like dev-v3.
Lots of suggestions for branch names in the chat -- seems that there was some consensus on dev-v3. Butcher will send a message out to the https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-kubernetes-helm list.

(Josh) Helm repo proposal:
https://github.com/kubernetes-helm/community/pull/18
https://github.com/jdolitsky/community/blob/ebf12b58dec108f85c582369d937100d591f7cdc/helm-v3/006-repositories.md
Methods for authentication -- suggestion to add a helm config for authentication
(Fisher) Have we looked at different authentication models eg. pypi authentication for pip packages?
Another thing to think about is being able to auth against different repos.
This has ramifications on helm search -- you would not be able to search against multiple repos.
Do you do search locally, or do you do search against service providers? This changes the UX in subtle ways since you need to be able to search against certain repos. It would be good to know how people are actually using helm search.
This has similarities with search with pypi -- might be useful to take a look at them too.
During the transition between Helm v2 and v3, it’s really important to be able to search through existing charts and retain backwards compatibility with them.
 (Farina) Do we have concrete requirements from users? Should we go out to users and poll for requirements -- what are the differences in requirements between startups / enterprises.
(Michael Hrivnak -- Welcome!): There is a tremendous amount of value to be had to not requiring a separate service for repositories. Also for enterprise users, they will require content on site. So anything we can do to help with that will be useful.

One appendix is to propose using the Lua engine for Helm plugins
Include a `helm push` verb to push helm charts to a repository

Discussion
Templating in values.yaml file (see #1978, #2133, #2492, #3252, and https://image.ibb.co/k9Xo07/tpl.png)
Folks would like to go down the road of being able to templatize values.yaml files. Is there a way of going about doing something like that?
Is there a primary use-case for this? The use-cases are documented in the multiple open issues.
Adam: Maybe comes across as an anti-pattern with
One solid use case: Ability to pass the name of a parent chart to a child chart. Does it make sense to solve this use case without templatizing values.yaml?
Other use case: Want to be able to set a value in values.yaml and use that over and over again, later on.
Taylor: Maybe implement this as an alpha feature (as a plugin): if a lot of people use it and find value, maybe move forward then since that may be something that the community wants.
Fisher: Two problems: There are no standard go libs for this. Also in this case people want to render values files before sending to helm. Can we use a plugin to solve some of this (at least initially?)
Adam: It might be possible to get the info in there (eg. parent chart) in a more structured way, rather than by having to templatize values files -- the latter would likely end up with debugging FSM nightmares.
Next steps: read through the issues, to understand the use cases before we can have a deeper discussion next week. Farina will reach out to rheinhardt to get a better idea for use-cases.
Reconnect to tiller on transport error (TODO: issue number -- Farina will follow up)
There are cases where the connection to tiller gets broken. Experiencing this on chart CI and is an outstanding issue.
Suggestion: helm and tiller support a connection via a service that’s created. With CI, it’s good to set up a service and point helm to that service -- you can also use a global portforward. This might be worth looking into for CI. Default helm init might already do this -- something to check.
Another option could be to keep the tunnel open.
Does grpc have an auto-reconnect that we can use?
We see the error in less than a minute on the CI tests so it’s not very long.
E2e tests (see #2846)
Adam will take it over -- has already rebased it. A few more things to clean up. Initial rebase (#3636)
Index.yaml v2 proposal (#3557)
Farina: Can we get more eyeballs on this?
This goes hand-in-hand with the scaling discussion for chart repositories. Has implications on the growing size of the community charts repositories.
We will try and cover this a bit more during the next meeting.

Matt Butcher
Helm summit things
Collecting some feedback on what are currently the most requested features for Helm -- to try and steer the Helm 3 discussion that way.
What is the long term structure / governance model for Helm? Is this something we want to discuss at the summit?
Open question: Is it better to lay down (discuss) suggested requirements, rather than dictate solutions for Helm 3?
Matt Fisher
Majority of the work was helping out with the Dev summit
Working with Ronan? To figure out logistics regarding the summit.
Michelle

Discussion
There are some bugs in 2.8
Helm list maximum client size exceeded (Justin’s case -- actually exceeding the 20 MB limit) 2.7 -> 2.8 bumped grpc, which made the client and server use the same size. Balboa has a new PR which updated the server client-receive size as well (apparently there are 3 settings that need to be updated). If this does fix it, does this warrant a 2.8.2, and if so -- do we wait until the summit to cut a 2.8.2?
Taylor / Butcher / Nikhil: Doesn’t seem like too many folks are affected by this - so probably prudent to wait until after summit.
Don’t need a dev call next week since we’ll be at the summit.
Michelle will send out an announcement on the ML and _all the places_, that we are at the summit next week, so things might be a bit slow.
Taylor: Maybe we should also put a message in the dev channel that we are at the summit, in case some high-pri issues do come up. (“Emergency mode”)

Upgrade bug for 2.8.0 which might hit people. Might need to issue a fix and cut a 2.8.1 release for issue 3382

Progress towards Helm Summit talk
Discussion
Kubernetes is going to shift away from the term “Master” (eg. drupal went with primary and replica, etc.) Propose to use something like API Server / Control Plane. There are places in docs where we use the term “Master” -- this needs to be updated.
Need a few more eyes on issue 3382 to figure out why upgrades are failing. Seems to be an issue with patch metadata.
We fixed a bug where we forgot to bump the version of the helm cli internally. And a couple of other bugs. Do we fix 3382 and cut a 2.8.1, or do we cut 2.8.1 without a fix for this since there are other fixes that we want to get out?
Was specifically asked to be noted that we finished 10 minutes early without MS folks around ;)

Discussion
Come to a final decision on how we are going to use test-infra and any concerns we have with it
Farina gave a demo on https://prow.k8s.io/plugin-help.html
Butcher: can we version pin plugins/opt out of new features e.g. new labels introduced in the label plugin?
Farina: policy on how we roll this out is discussing right now in SIG test infra
Feedback: adding too much heavy-handed test automation is not required for smaller projects like Helm; it does not need a whole lot of tooling because the process is intentionally simple
Farina is hoping more people to come to SIG contribex to provide this feedback
Best option is to look at the plugin repo to see what we can opt in (and out) of
Building for other architectures
Opinions on releasing a separate docker image for Helm vs Tiller?
Going forward with splitting into separate docker images
Looking forward to supporting alternate architectures
Publish these images to Dockerhub? Conversations leaned towards “yes”
Helm v2.8 release
Planning to cut the release next week, Fisher will take the lead. Farina and Taylor are interested in pairing to understand the release process

Getting ready for 2.8 release
Discussion
RBAC best practices changes
Do we create a service account for each service by default (in Tiller)?
A service account per service is a pretty good idea
There is a debate about whether or not we should have Tiller do this.
The resolution is that we go forward with adding service account creation in the charts themselves and not tiller
Feedback requested: Common labels (mattfarina)
Common labels allow for some really good possibilities for visualization
K8s tooling (/lgtm, /approve and owners file changes) (mattfarina)
Kubernetes is wanting everyone to use the test-infra tools. Do we want to use them?
There are some useful testing functions that the tools enable, like tests right before a merge
If we have issues with having these enforced, we need to let people know at https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra
CRD stuff (Justin)
Moved to next week. This is about changing the validation piece so CRDs function properly
We are ok if someone wants to refactor the validation
