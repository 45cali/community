# Helm Community

Welcome to the Helm community!

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor to the Helm project - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

## Communicating

The [communication](communication.md) page lists communication channels like chat,
issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

## Meetings

The Helm community holds regular public meetings, including those supporting Helm
client development and charts. You can [view the calendar of meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=s5anaqbm9kda435dnh5r8lj1l8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)
and [subscribe via an ical](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/s5anaqbm9kda435dnh5r8lj1l8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) feed.

## How Can I Help?

Documentation (like the text you are reading now) can
always use improvement!

There's always code that can be clarified and variables
or functions that can be renamed or commented.

There's always a need for more test coverage.

## Your First Contribution

We recommend that you work on existing [issues] before attempting
to develop a new feature.

Find an existing issue (e.g. one marked [starter], or simply
ask an [owner](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/OWNERS) for suggestions), and respond on the
issue thread expressing interest in working on it.

This helps other people know that the issue is active, and
hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

Each commit must be signed off in git, as described by
[the article](https://www.helm.sh/blog/helm-dco/index.html)
describing Helm's switch to DCO.

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

  1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
  1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
  1. If your proposed change is accepted,
     start work in your fork, signing off each commit as described above
  1. Submit a [pull request] containing a tested change.
