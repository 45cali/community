# Kubernetes Community

Welcome to the Kubernetes community!

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor to the Helm project - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

## Communicating

The [communication](communication.md) page lists communication channels like chat,
issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

## How Can I Help?

Documentation (like the text you are reading now) can
always use improvement!

There's always code that can be clarified and variables
or functions that can be renamed or commented.

There's always a need for more test coverage.

## Your First Contribution

We recommend that you work on existing [issues] before attempting
to develop a new feature.

Find an existing issue (e.g. one marked [starter], or simply
ask an [owner](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/tree/master/OWNERS.md) for suggestions), and respond on the
issue thread expressing interest in working on it. 
 
This helps other people know that the issue is active, and
hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

Before submitting a pull request, sign the [CLA].

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

  1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
  1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
  1. If your proposed change is accepted,
     sign the [CLA],
     and start work in your fork.
  1. Submit a [pull request] containing a tested change.
