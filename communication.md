# Communication

The Helm community abides by the [CNCF code of conduct].  Here is an excerpt:

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest
> of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect
> all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
> requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
> and other activities._

## SIGs

Kubernetes encompasses many projects, organized into [SIGs].
Helm reports to Kubernetes' [SIG-Apps] which has its own communication
channels and weekly meetings.

Nevertheless, below find a list of Helm-specific channels, groups
and meetings.

## Social Media

* [Twitter]
* Pose questions and help answer them on [Slack][slack.k8s.io] or [Stack Overflow].

## Slack

Most real time discussion happens at #helm-users on [kubernetes.slack.com];
you can sign up at [slack.k8s.io].

There is also a #helm-dev channel for discussing development of Helm.
 
Discussions on these channels are archived at [kubernetes.slackarchive.io].

## Issues

Issues are used as the primary method for tracking anything to do with the Helm project.

See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues)
for information on how to [file an issue] if you think you have found a bug or have a feature request.

## Mailing lists

Development announcements and discussions appear on the Helm mailing list
[cncf-helm] (send mail to `cncf-helm@lists.cncf.io`).

## Weekly Meeting

We have PUBLIC [weekly meeting] every Thursday at 9:30am US Pacific Time.

Map that to your local time with this [timezone table].

## Conferences

Helm is one of the projects, represented at CloudNativeCon/KubeCon, held three times per year in Europe, Asia and North America. Information about these and other community events is available on the CNCF [events] pages.

Also, Helm community origanizes the Helm-focused event - [Helm Summit], first
edition of which has happened in Portland, Oregon in February 2018.
